1,Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity Reconstruction of Surgical Scenes,"Jiwei Shan,Zeyu Cai,Cheng-Tai Hsieh,Shing Shin Cheng,Hesheng Wang","Efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is a critical yet challenging task. Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians, effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01101,
2,PG-SAG: Parallel Gaussian Splatting for Fine-Grained Large-Scale Urban Buildings Reconstruction via Semantic-Aware Grouping,"Tengfei Wang,Xin Wang,Yongmao Hou,Yiwei Xu,Wendi Zhang,Zongqian Zhan","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a transformative method in the field of real-time novel synthesis. Based on 3DGS, recent advancements cope with large-scale scenes via spatial-based partition strategy to reduce video memory and optimization time costs. In this work, we introduce a parallel Gaussian splatting method, termed PG-SAG, which fully exploits semantic cues for both partitioning and Gaussian kernel optimization, enabling fine-grained building surface reconstruction of large-scale urban areas without downsampling the original image resolution. First, the Cross-modal model - Language Segment Anything is leveraged to segment building masks. Then, the segmented building regions is grouped into sub-regions according to the visibility check across registered images. The Gaussian kernels for these sub-regions are optimized in parallel with masked pixels. In addition, the normal loss is re-formulated for the detected edges of masks to alleviate the ambiguities in normal vectors on edges. Finally, to improve the optimization of 3D Gaussians, we introduce a gradient-constrained balance-load loss that accounts for the complexity of the corresponding scenes, effectively minimizing the thread waiting time in the pixel-parallel rendering stage as well as the reconstruction lost. Extensive experiments are tested on various urban datasets, the results demonstrated the superior performance of our PG-SAG on building surface reconstruction, compared to several state-of-the-art 3DGS-based methods.

3,Cloth-Splatting: 3D Cloth State Estimation from RGB Supervision,"Alberta Longhini,Marcel B\xc3\xbcsching,Bardienus P. Duisterhof,Jens Lundell,Jeffrey Ichnowski,M\xc3\xa5rten Bj\xc3\xb6rkman,Danica Kragic","We introduce Cloth-Splatting, a method for estimating 3D states of cloth from RGB images through a prediction-update framework. Cloth-Splatting leverages an action-conditioned dynamics model for predicting future states and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to update the predicted states. Our key insight is that coupling a 3D mesh-based representation with Gaussian Splatting allows us to define a differentiable map between the cloth state space and the image space. This enables the use of gradient-based optimization techniques to refine inaccurate state estimates using only RGB supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that Cloth-Splatting not only improves state estimation accuracy over current baselines but also reduces convergence time.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01715,
4,DreamDrive: Generative 4D Scene Modeling from Street View Images,"Jiageng Mao,Boyi Li,Boris Ivanovic,Yuxiao Chen,Yan Wang,Yurong You,Chaowei Xiao,Danfei Xu,Marco Pavone,Yue Wang","Synthesizing photo-realistic visual observations from an ego vehicle's driving trajectory is a critical step towards scalable training of self-driving models. Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present DreamDrive, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and street view images demonstrate that DreamDrive can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00601,
5,BeSplat: Gaussian Splatting from a Single Blurry Image and Event Stream,"Gopi Raju Matta,Reddypalli Trisha,Kaushik Mitra","Novel view synthesis has been greatly enhanced by the development of radiance field methods. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has effectively addressed key challenges, such as long training times and slow rendering speeds, typically associated with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), while maintaining high-quality reconstructions. In this work (BeSplat), we demonstrate the recovery of sharp radiance field (Gaussian splats) from a single motion-blurred image and its corresponding event stream. Our method jointly learns the scene representation via Gaussian Splatting and recovers the camera motion through Bezier SE(3) formulation effectively, minimizing discrepancies between synthesized and real-world measurements of both blurry image and corresponding event stream. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real datasets, showcasing its ability to render view-consistent, sharp images from the learned radiance field and the estimated camera trajectory. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to address this highly challenging ill-posed problem in a Gaussian Splatting framework with the effective incorporation of temporal information captured using the event stream.",December 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19370,
6,GS-DiT: Advancing Video Generation with Pseudo 4D Gaussian Fields through Efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking,"Weikang Bian,Zhaoyang Huang,Xiaoyu Shi,Yijin Li,Fu-Yun Wang,Hongsheng Li","4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of sophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom, which are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production.

7,HOGSA: Bimanual Hand-Object Interaction Understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting Based Data Augmentation,"Wentian Qu,Jiahe Li,Jian Cheng,Jian Shi,Chenyu Meng,Cuixia Ma,Hongan Wang,Xiaoming Deng,Yinda Zhang","Understanding of bimanual hand-object interaction plays an important role in robotics and virtual reality. However, due to significant occlusions between hands and object as well as the high degree-of-freedom motions, it is challenging to collect and annotate a high-quality, large-scale dataset, which prevents further improvement of bimanual hand-object interaction-related baselines. In this work, we propose a new 3D Gaussian Splatting based data augmentation framework for bimanual hand-object interaction, which is capable of augmenting existing dataset to large-scale photorealistic data with various hand-object pose and viewpoints. First, we use mesh-based 3DGS to model objects and hands, and to deal with the rendering blur problem due to multi-resolution input images used, we design a super-resolution module. Second, we extend the single hand grasping pose optimization module for the bimanual hand object to generate various poses of bimanual hand-object interaction, which can significantly expand the pose distribution of the dataset. Third, we conduct an analysis for the impact of different aspects of the proposed data augmentation on the understanding of the bimanual hand-object interaction. We perform our data augmentation on two benchmarks, H2O and Arctic, and verify that our method can improve the performance of the baselines.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02845,
8,Gaussian Masked Autoencoders,"Jathushan Rajasegaran,Xinlei Chen,Rulilong Li,Christoph Feichtenhofer,Jitendra Malik,Shiry Ginosar","This paper explores Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with Gaussian Splatting. While reconstructive self-supervised learning frameworks such as MAE learns good semantic abstractions, it is not trained for explicit spatial awareness. Our approach, named Gaussian Masked Autoencoder, or GMAE, aims to learn semantic abstractions and spatial understanding jointly. Like MAE, it reconstructs the image end-to-end in the pixel space, but beyond MAE, it also introduces an intermediate, 3D Gaussian-based representation and renders images via splatting. We show that GMAE can enable various zero-shot learning capabilities of spatial understanding (e.g., figure-ground segmentation, image layering, edge detection, etc.) while preserving the high-level semantics of self-supervised representation quality from MAE. To our knowledge, we are the first to employ Gaussian primitives in an image representation learning framework beyond optimization-based single-scene reconstructions. We believe GMAE will inspire further research in this direction and contribute to developing next-generation techniques for modeling high-fidelity visual data.

9,Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting with Optimized Feature Planes and Standard Video Codecs,"Soonbin Lee,Fangwen Shu,Yago Sanchez,Thomas Schierl,Cornelius Hellge","3D Gaussian Splatting is a recognized method for 3D scene representation, known for its high rendering quality and speed. However, its substantial data requirements present challenges for practical applications. In this paper, we introduce an efficient compression technique that significantly reduces storage overhead by using compact representation. We propose a unified architecture that combines point cloud data and feature planes through a progressive tri-plane structure. Our method utilizes 2D feature planes, enabling continuous spatial representation. To further optimize these representations, we incorporate entropy modeling in the frequency domain, specifically designed for standard video codecs. We also propose channel-wise bit allocation to achieve a better trade-off between bitrate consumption and feature plane representation. Consequently, our model effectively leverages spatial correlations within the feature planes to enhance rate-distortion performance using standard, non-differentiable video codecs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in data compactness while maintaining high rendering quality.

10,ConcealGS: Concealing Invisible Copyright Information in 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Yifeng Yang,Hengyu Liu,Chenxin Li,Yining Sun,Wuyang Li,Yifan Liu,Yiyang Lin,Yixuan Yuan,Nanyang Ye","With the rapid development of 3D reconstruction technology, the widespread distribution of 3D data has become a future trend. While traditional visual data (such as images and videos) and NeRF-based formats already have mature techniques for copyright protection, steganographic techniques for the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) format have yet to be fully explored. To address this, we propose ConcealGS, an innovative method for embedding implicit information into 3D-GS. By introducing the knowledge distillation and gradient optimization strategy based on 3D-GS, ConcealGS overcomes the limitations of NeRF-based models and enhances the robustness of implicit information and the quality of 3D reconstruction. We evaluate ConcealGS in various potential application scenarios, and experimental results have demonstrated that ConcealGS not only successfully recovers implicit information but also has almost no impact on rendering quality, providing a new approach for embedding invisible and recoverable information into 3D models in the future.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03605,
11,ZDySS -- Zero-Shot Dynamic Scene Stylization using Gaussian Splatting,"Abhishek Saroha,Florian Hofherr,Mariia Gladkova,Cecilia Curreli,Or Litany,Daniel Cremers","Stylizing a dynamic scene based on an exemplar image is critical for various real-world applications, including gaming, filmmaking, and augmented and virtual reality. However, achieving consistent stylization across both spatial and temporal dimensions remains a significant challenge. Most existing methods are designed for static scenes and often require an optimization process for each style image, limiting their adaptability. We introduce ZDySS, a zero-shot stylization framework for dynamic scenes, allowing our model to generalize to previously unseen style images at inference. Our approach employs Gaussian splatting for scene representation, linking each Gaussian to a learned feature vector that renders a feature map for any given view and timestamp. By applying style transfer on the learned feature vectors instead of the rendered feature map, we enhance spatio-temporal consistency across frames. Our method demonstrates superior performance and coherence over state-of-the-art baselines in tests on real-world dynamic scenes, making it a robust solution for practical applications.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03875,
12,FatesGS: Fast and Accurate Sparse-View Surface Reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting with Depth-Feature Consistency,"Han Huang,Yulun Wu,Chao Deng,Ge Gao,Ming Gu,Yu-Shen Liu","Recently, Gaussian Splatting has sparked a new trend in the field of computer vision. Apart from novel view synthesis, it has also been extended to the area of multi-view reconstruction. The latest methods facilitate complete, detailed surface reconstruction while ensuring fast training speed. However, these methods still require dense input views, and their output quality significantly degrades with sparse views. We observed that the Gaussian primitives tend to overfit the few training views, leading to noisy floaters and incomplete reconstruction surfaces. In this paper, we present an innovative sparse-view reconstruction framework that leverages intra-view depth and multi-view feature consistency to achieve remarkably accurate surface reconstruction. Specifically, we utilize monocular depth ranking information to supervise the consistency of depth distribution within patches and employ a smoothness loss to enhance the continuity of the distribution. To achieve finer surface reconstruction, we optimize the absolute position of depth through multi-view projection features. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a speedup of 60x to 200x, achieving swift and fine-grained mesh reconstruction without the need for costly pre-training.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04628,
13,GaussianVideo: Efficient Video Representation via Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting,"Andrew Bond,Jui-Hsien Wang,Long Mai,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem","Efficient neural representations for dynamic video scenes are critical for applications ranging from video compression to interactive simulations. Yet, existing methods often face challenges related to high memory usage, lengthy training times, and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce a novel neural video representation that combines 3D Gaussian splatting with continuous camera motion modeling. By leveraging Neural ODEs, our approach learns smooth camera trajectories while maintaining an explicit 3D scene representation through Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a spatiotemporal hierarchical learning strategy, progressively refining spatial and temporal features to enhance reconstruction quality and accelerate convergence. This memory-efficient approach achieves high-quality rendering at impressive speeds. Experimental results show that our hierarchical learning, combined with robust camera motion modeling, captures complex dynamic scenes with strong temporal consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse video datasets in both high- and low-motion scenarios.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04782,
14,Zero-1-to-G: Taming Pretrained 2D Diffusion Model for Direct 3D Generation,"Xuyi Meng,Chen Wang,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu","Recent advances in 2D image generation have achieved remarkable quality,largely driven by the capacity of diffusion models and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, direct 3D generation is still constrained by the scarcity and lower fidelity of 3D datasets. In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes. This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models. To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats. This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05427,
15,PGSR: Planar-based Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity Surface Reconstruction,"Danpeng Chen,Hai Li,Weicai Ye,Yifan Wang,Weijian Xie,Shangjin Zhai,Nan Wang,Haomin Liu,Hujun Bao,Guofeng Zhang","Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted widespread attention due to its high-quality rendering, and ultra-fast training and rendering speed. However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, it is difficult to guarantee geometric reconstruction accuracy and multi-view consistency simply by relying on image reconstruction loss. Although many studies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, the quality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation (PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuring high-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depth rendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin to the Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussian distribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiased depth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, and geometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also propose a camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with large illumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelity rendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-based methods.",June 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06521,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2024.3494046
16,Splat-Nav: Safe Real-Time Robot Navigation in Gaussian Splatting Maps,"Timothy Chen,Ola Shorinwa,Joseph Bruno,Aiden Swann,Javier Yu,Weijia Zeng,Keiko Nagami,Philip Dames,Mac Schwager","We present Splat-Nav, a real-time robot navigation pipeline for Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) scenes, a powerful new 3D scene representation. Splat-Nav consists of two components: 1) Splat-Plan, a safe planning module, and 2) Splat-Loc, a robust vision-based pose estimation module. Splat-Plan builds a safe-by-construction polytope corridor through the map based on mathematically rigorous collision constraints and then constructs a B\xc3\xa9zier curve trajectory through this corridor. Splat-Loc provides real-time recursive state estimates given only an RGB feed from an on-board camera, leveraging the point-cloud representation inherent in GSplat scenes. Working together, these modules give robots the ability to recursively re-plan smooth and safe trajectories to goal locations. Goals can be specified with position coordinates, or with language commands by using a semantic GSplat. We demonstrate improved safety compared to point cloud-based methods in extensive simulation experiments. In a total of 126 hardware flights, we demonstrate equivalent safety and speed compared to motion capture and visual odometry, but without a manual frame alignment required by those methods. We show online re-planning at more than 2 Hz and pose estimation at about 25 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby enabling real-time navigation.

Christensen,Liu Ren","Online mapping reduces the reliance of autonomous vehicles on high-definition (HD) maps, significantly enhancing scalability. However, recent advancements often overlook cross-sensor configuration generalization, leading to performance degradation when models are deployed on vehicles with different camera intrinsics and extrinsics. With the rapid evolution of novel view synthesis methods, we investigate the extent to which these techniques can be leveraged to address the sensor configuration generalization challenge. We propose a novel framework leveraging Gaussian splatting to reconstruct scenes and render camera images in target sensor configurations. The target config sensor data, along with labels mapped to the target config, are used to train online mapping models. Our proposed framework on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrates a performance improvement of 18% through effective dataset augmentation, achieves faster convergence and efficient training, and exceeds state-of-the-art performance when using only 25% of the original training data.

We utilize the explicit mesh geometry to represent motion and shape of a virtual human and implicit appearance rendering with Gaussian Splatting. Our method consists of two main modules: Gaussian initialization module and Gaussian rectification module. We embed Gaussians into triangular faces and control their motion through the mesh, which ensures low-frequency motion and surface deformation of the avatar. Due to the limitations of LBS formula, the human skeleton is hard to control complex non-rigid transformations. We then design a pose-related Gaussian rectification module to learn fine-detailed non-rigid deformations, further improving the realism and expressiveness of the avatar.

Given the underconstrained nature of this problem, incorporating prior knowledge is essential. Therefore, we propose a framework comprising prior learning and avatar creation phases. The prior learning phase leverages 3D head priors derived from a large-scale multi-view dynamic dataset, and the avatar creation phase applies these priors for few-shot personalization. Our approach effectively captures these priors by utilizing a Gaussian Splatting-based auto-decoder network with part-based dynamic modeling. Our method employs identity-shared encoding with personalized latent codes for individual identities to learn the attributes of Gaussian primitives. During the avatar creation phase, we achieve fast head avatar personalization by leveraging inversion and fine-tuning strategies.

20,Evaluating Human Perception of Novel View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment of Gaussian Splatting and NeRF in Dynamic Scenes,"Yuhang Zhang,Joshua Maraval,Zhengyu Zhang,Nicolas Ramin,Shishun Tian,Lu Zhang","Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are two groundbreaking technologies that have revolutionized the field of Novel View Synthesis (NVS), enabling immersive photorealistic rendering and user experiences by synthesizing multiple viewpoints from a set of images of sparse views. The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and augmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging, underscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the perspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored subjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several challenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and evaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two subjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies containing both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and real-world scenes. This study covers 360\xc2\xb0, front-facing, and single-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real scenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in dynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments help to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human perception perspective and pave the way for future development of full-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a comprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the proposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to accurately capture subjective quality.

21,3DGS-to-PC: Convert a 3D Gaussian Splatting Scene into a Dense Point Cloud or Mesh,"Lewis A G Stuart,Michael P Pound","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels at producing highly detailed 3D reconstructions, but these scenes often require specialised renderers for effective visualisation. In contrast, point clouds are a widely used 3D representation and are compatible with most popular 3D processing software, yet converting 3DGS scenes into point clouds is a complex challenge. In this work we introduce 3DGS-to-PC, a flexible and highly customisable framework that is capable of transforming 3DGS scenes into dense, high-accuracy point clouds. We sample points probabilistically from each Gaussian as a 3D density function. We additionally threshold new points using the Mahalanobis distance to the Gaussian centre, preventing extreme outliers. The result is a point cloud that closely represents the shape encoded into the 3D Gaussian scene. Individual Gaussians use spherical harmonics to adapt colours depending on view, and each point may contribute only subtle colour hints to the resulting rendered scene. To avoid spurious or incorrect colours that do not fit with the final point cloud, we recalculate Gaussian colours via a customised image rendering approach, assigning each Gaussian the colour of the pixel to which it contributes most across all views. 3DGS-to-PC also supports mesh generation through Poisson Surface Reconstruction, applied to points sampled from predicted surface Gaussians. This allows coloured meshes to be generated from 3DGS scenes without the need for re-training. This package is highly customisable and capability of simple integration into existing 3DGS pipelines. 3DGS-to-PC provides a powerful tool for converting 3DGS data into point cloud and surface-based formats.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07478,

To achieve that, we extend such a model for diverse-view human head generation by fine-tuning on synthetic data and modifying its conditioning. Our avatars maintain a dense correspondence with a human face mesh template, allowing blendshape-based expression generation. This is achieved through a modified 3DGS approach, connectivity regularizers, and a strategic initialization tailored for our task. Additionally, we propose an optional efficient SDS-based correction step to refine the blendshape expressions, enhancing realism and diversity.

The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map.

This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor.

However, its reliance on photometric losses can lead to imprecisely reconstructed geometry and extracted meshes, especially in regions with high curvature or fine detail. We propose a novel regularization method using the gradients of a signed distance function estimated from the Gaussians, to improve the quality of rendering while also extracting a surface mesh. The regularizing normal supervision facilitates better rendering and mesh reconstruction, which is crucial for downstream applications in video generation, animation, AR-VR and gaming.

However, existing vision-only 3D-GS methods often rely on hand-crafted heuristics for point-cloud densification and face challenges in handling occlusions and high GPU memory and computation consumption. LiDAR-Inertial-Visual (LIV) sensor configuration has demonstrated superior performance in localization and dense mapping by leveraging complementary sensing characteristics: rich texture information from cameras, precise geometric measurements from LiDAR, and high-frequency motion data from IMU. Inspired by this, we propose a novel real-time Gaussian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Our map system comprises a global Gaussian map and a sliding window of Gaussians, along with an IESKF-based odometry. The global Gaussian map consists of hash-indexed voxels organized in a recursive octree, effectively covering sparse spatial volumes while adapting to different levels of detail and scales. The Gaussian map is initialized through multi-sensor fusion and optimized with photometric gradients. Our system incrementally maintains a sliding window of Gaussians, significantly reducing GPU computation and memory consumption by only optimizing the map within the sliding window. Moreover, we implement a tightly coupled multi-sensor fusion odometry with an iterative error state Kalman filter (IESKF), leveraging real-time updating and rendering of the Gaussian map. Our system represents the first real-time Gaussian-based SLAM framework deployable on resource-constrained embedded systems, demonstrated on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX platform.

Our approach estimates 3D object-level changes by comparing two sets of unaligned images taken at different times. Leveraging 3DGS's novel view rendering and EfficientSAM's zero-shot segmentation capabilities, we detect 2D object-level changes, which are then associated and fused across views to estimate 3D change masks and object transformations. Our method can accurately identify changes in cluttered environments using sparse (as few as one) post-change images within as little as 18s. It does not rely on depth input, user instructions, pre-defined object classes, or object models -- An object is recognized simply if it has been re-arranged.

These variations can lead to floaters and color distortions in the rendered images/videos. Recent appearance modeling approaches in Gaussian Splatting are either tightly coupled with the rendering process, hindering real-time rendering, or they only account for mild global variations, performing poorly in scenes with local light changes. In this paper, we propose DAVIGS, a method that decouples appearance variations in a plug-and-play and efficient manner. By transforming the rendering results at the image level instead of the Gaussian level, our approach can model appearance variations with minimal optimization time and memory overhead. Furthermore, our method gathers appearance-related information in 3D space to transform the rendered images, thus building 3D consistency across views implicitly. We validate our method on several appearance-variant scenes, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with minimal training time and memory usage, without compromising rendering speeds.

To remedy these problems, we propose SAGD, a conceptually simple yet effective boundary-enhanced segmentation pipeline for 3D-GS to improve segmentation accuracy while preserving segmentation speed. Specifically, we introduce a Gaussian Decomposition scheme, which ingeniously utilizes the special structure of 3D Gaussian, finds out, and then decomposes the boundary Gaussians. Moreover, to achieve fast interactive 3D segmentation, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline by lifting a 2D foundation model to 3D-GS.

While advanced techniques like radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve rendering quality and impressive efficiency with dense view inputs, they suffer from significant geometric reconstruction errors when applied to sparse input views. Moreover, although recent methods leverage monocular depth estimation to enhance geometric learning, their dependence on single-view estimated depth often leads to view inconsistency issues across different viewpoints. Consequently, this reliance on absolute depth can introduce inaccuracies in geometric information, ultimately compromising the quality of scene reconstruction with Gaussian splats. In this paper, we present RDG-GS, a novel sparse-view 3D rendering framework with Relative Depth Guidance based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The core innovation lies in utilizing relative depth guidance to refine the Gaussian field, steering it towards view-consistent spatial geometric representations, thereby enabling the reconstruction of accurate geometric structures and capturing intricate textures. First, we devise refined depth priors to rectify the coarse estimated depth and insert global and fine-grained scene information to regular Gaussians. Building on this, to address spatial geometric inaccuracies from absolute depth, we propose relative depth guidance by optimizing the similarity between spatially correlated patches of depth and images. Additionally, we also directly deal with the sparse areas challenging to converge by the adaptive sampling for quick densification. Across extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF360, LLFF, DTU, and Blender, RDG-GS demonstrates state-of-the-art rendering quality and efficiency, making a significant advancement for real-world application.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11102,

To address this issue, we propose a sparse-view 3DGS method. Given the inherently ill-posed nature of sparse-view rendering, incorporating prior information is crucial. We propose a semantic regularization technique, using features extracted from the pretrained DINO-ViT model, to ensure multi-view semantic consistency.

However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing reconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to recover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly modeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging the explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation process through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce DehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background from participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model the transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of fog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In the inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on the Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view.

GSVC incorporates the following techniques: (i) To exploit temporal redundancy among adjacent frames, which can speed up training and improve the compression efficiency, we predict the Gaussian splats of a frame based on its previous frame; (ii) To control the trade-offs between file size and quality, we remove Gaussian splats with low contribution to the video quality; (iii) To capture dynamics in videos, we randomly add Gaussian splats to fit content with large motion or newly-appeared objects; (iv) To handle significant changes in the scene, we detect key frames based on loss differences during the learning process.

However, its high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical applications. We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics that are analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- Like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features like edges and contours; While other Gaussians represent broader, smoother regions, that are analogous to broader brush strokes that add volume and depth to a painting. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which define scene boundaries, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover smooth regions. Sketch Gaussians are efficiently encoded using parametric models, leveraging their geometric coherence, while Patch Gaussians undergo optimized pruning, retraining, and vector quantization to maintain volumetric consistency and storage efficiency.

While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements. This proposal not only enhances the performance of Gaussian Splatting SLAM beyond room-scale scenarios but also achieves SLAM performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in large-scale indoor environments.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13402,

To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure.

The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians' opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians. During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS.

By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training.

It differs from previous 3D generative models by effectively utilizing web-scale 2D priors while maintaining 3D consistency in a unified model. To bootstrap the training, a lightweight reconstruction model is proposed to instantly produce multi-view Gaussian splat grids for scalable dataset curation.

49,FeatureGS: Eigenvalue-Feature Optimization in 3D Gaussian Splatting for Geometrically Accurate and Artifact-Reduced Reconstruction,"Miriam J\xc3\xa4ger,Markus Hillemann,Boris Jutzi","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach for 3D scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussians. However, neither the centers nor surfaces of the Gaussians are accurately aligned to the object surface, complicating their direct use in point cloud and mesh reconstruction. Additionally, 3DGS typically produces floater artifacts, increasing the number of Gaussians and storage requirements. To address these issues, we present FeatureGS, which incorporates an additional geometric loss term based on an eigenvalue-derived 3D shape feature into the optimization process of 3DGS. The goal is to improve geometric accuracy and enhance properties of planar surfaces with reduced structural entropy in local 3D neighborhoods.We present four alternative formulations for the geometric loss term based on 'planarity' of Gaussians, as well as 'planarity', 'omnivariance', and 'eigenentropy' of Gaussian neighborhoods. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 15 scenes of the DTU benchmark dataset focusing on following key aspects: Geometric accuracy and artifact-reduction, measured by the Chamfer distance, and memory efficiency, evaluated by the total number of Gaussians. Additionally, rendering quality is monitored by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio. FeatureGS achieves a 30 % improvement in geometric accuracy, reduces the number of Gaussians by 90 %, and suppresses floater artifacts, while maintaining comparable photometric rendering quality. The geometric loss with 'planarity' from Gaussians provides the highest geometric accuracy, while 'omnivariance' in Gaussian neighborhoods reduces floater artifacts and number of Gaussians the most. This makes FeatureGS a strong method for geometrically accurate, artifact-reduced and memory-efficient 3D scene reconstruction, enabling the direct use of Gaussian centers for geometric representation.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17655,

On these devices, memory is often limited in capacity and its access often dominates the consumption of compute energy. Although Gaussian Splatting (GS) allows for high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D scenes, current GS-based SLAM is not memory efficient as a large number of past images is stored to retrain Gaussians for reducing catastrophic forgetting. These images often require two-orders-of-magnitude higher memory than the map itself and thus dominate the total memory usage. In this work, we present GEVO, a GS-based monocular SLAM framework that achieves comparable fidelity as prior methods by rendering (instead of storing) them from the existing map. Novel Gaussian initialization and optimization techniques are proposed to remove artifacts from the map and delay the degradation of the rendered images over time. Across a variety of environments, GEVO achieves comparable map fidelity while reducing the memory overhead to around 58 MBs, which is up to 94x lower than prior works.",September 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09295,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2025.3534683

Furthermore, considering the requirements of interactive and rendering applications, it is essential to achieve real-time rendering and driveability of the digital model without compromising rendering quality. Thus, we propose Jointly 3D Gaussian Hand (JGHand), a novel joint-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based hand representation that renders high-fidelity hand images in real-time for various poses and characters. Distinct from existing articulated neural rendering techniques, we introduce a differentiable process for spatial transformations based on 3D key points. This process supports deformations from the canonical template to a mesh with arbitrary bone lengths and poses. Additionally, we propose a real-time shadow simulation method based on per-pixel depth to simulate self-occlusion shadows caused by finger movements. Finally, we embed the hand prior and propose an animatable 3DGS representation of the hand driven solely by 3D key points. We validate the effectiveness of each component of our approach through comprehensive ablation studies.

52,VoD-3DGS: View-opacity-Dependent 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Mateusz Nowak,Wojciech Jarosz,Peter Chin","Reconstructing a 3D scene from images is challenging due to the different ways light interacts with surfaces depending on the viewer's position and the surface's material. In classical computer graphics, materials can be classified as diffuse or specular, interacting with light differently. The standard 3D Gaussian Splatting model struggles to represent view-dependent content, since it cannot differentiate an object within the scene from the light interacting with its specular surfaces, which produce highlights or reflections. In this paper, we propose to extend the 3D Gaussian Splatting model by introducing an additional symmetric matrix to enhance the opacity representation of each 3D Gaussian. This improvement allows certain Gaussians to be suppressed based on the viewer's perspective, resulting in a more accurate representation of view-dependent reflections and specular highlights without compromising the scene's integrity. By allowing the opacity to be view dependent, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-Nerf, Tanks&Temples, Deep Blending, and Nerf-Synthetic datasets without a significant loss in rendering speed, achieving >60FPS, and only incurring a minimal increase in memory used.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17978,

This representation offers numerous advantages, including rapid training and rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the challenge of incorporating light and shadow reflections, primarily due to the utilization of rasterization rather than ray tracing for rendering. This paper introduces RaySplats, a model that employs ray-tracing based Gaussian Splatting. Rather than utilizing the projection of Gaussians, our method employs a ray-tracing mechanism, operating directly on Gaussian primitives represented by confidence ellipses with RGB colors. In practice, we compute the intersection between ellipses and rays to construct ray-tracing algorithms, facilitating the incorporation of meshes with Gaussian Splatting models and the addition of lights, shadows, and other related effects.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19196,

While recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved SLAM with high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering, these systems struggle with accurate depth and surface reconstruction due to multi-view inconsistencies. Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time endoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these challenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\\pm 0.63$ mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering.

Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

In this paper, we unveil a fresh approach that blends state-space modeling with Wasserstein geometry, paving the way for a more fluid and coherent representation of dynamic scenes. We introduce a State Consistency Filter that merges prior predictions with the current observations, enabling Gaussians to stay true to their way over time. We also employ Wasserstein distance regularization to ensure smooth, consistent updates of Gaussian parameters, reducing motion artifacts. Lastly, we leverage Wasserstein geometry to capture both translational motion and shape deformations, creating a more physically plausible model for dynamic scenes. Our approach guides Gaussians along their natural way in the Wasserstein space, achieving smoother, more realistic motion and stronger temporal coherence. Experimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality and efficiency, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.",December 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00333,

However, since it is typically trained on only a short video that lacks the diversity in facial emotions, the resultant talking heads struggle to represent a wide range of emotions. To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00654,

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques.

Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization.

Our approach employs a diffusion-based architecture to refine noisy 6DoF camera poses towards plausible locations, with conditional signals derived from pre-trained text encoders. Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning.

To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.",December 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19282,
62,GaussNav: Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation,"Xiaohan Lei,Min Wang,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li","In embodied vision, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) requires an agent to locate a specific object depicted in a goal image within an unexplored environment. The primary challenge of IIN arises from the need to recognize the target object across varying viewpoints while ignoring potential distractors. Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instance-level tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

63,RayGauss: Volumetric Gaussian-Based Ray Casting for Photorealistic Novel View Synthesis,"Hugo Blanc,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud,Alexis Paljic","Differentiable volumetric rendering-based methods made significant progress in novel view synthesis. On one hand, innovative methods have replaced the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) network with locally parameterized structures, enabling high-quality renderings in a reasonable time. On the other hand, approaches have used differentiable splatting instead of NeRF's ray casting to optimize radiance fields rapidly using Gaussian kernels, allowing for fine adaptation to the scene. However, differentiable ray casting of irregularly spaced kernels has been scarcely explored, while splatting, despite enabling fast rendering times, is susceptible to clearly visible artifacts.  Our work closes this gap by providing a physically consistent formulation of the emitted radiance c and density \xcf\x83, decomposed with Gaussian functions associated with Spherical Gaussians/Harmonics for all-frequency colorimetric representation. We also introduce a method enabling differentiable ray casting of irregularly distributed Gaussians using an algorithm that integrates radiance fields slab by slab and leverages a BVH structure. This allows our approach to finely adapt to the scene while avoiding splatting artifacts.

Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds.

Given 2D visual prompts as input, SAGA can segment the corresponding 3D target represented by 3D Gaussians within 4 ms. This is achieved by attaching an scale-gated affinity feature to each 3D Gaussian to endow it a new property towards multi-granularity segmentation. Specifically, a scale-aware contrastive training strategy is proposed for the scale-gated affinity feature learning. It 1) distills the segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from 2D masks into the affinity features and 2) employs a soft scale gate mechanism to deal with multi-granularity ambiguity in 3D segmentation through adjusting the magnitude of each feature channel according to a specified 3D physical scale.

However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion.

74,"SIREN: Semantic, Initialization-Free Registration of Multi-Robot Gaussian Splatting Maps","Ola Shorinwa,Jiankai Sun,Mac Schwager,Anirudha Majumdar","We present SIREN for registration of multi-robot Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) maps, with zero access to camera poses, images, and inter-map transforms for initialization or fusion of local submaps. To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle.

75,TranSplat: Surface Embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Transparent Object Manipulation,"Jeongyun Kim,Jeongho Noh,Dong-Guw Lee,Ayoung Kim","Transparent object manipulation remains a significant challenge in robotics due to the difficulty of acquiring accurate and dense depth measurements. Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in incomplete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transparent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

76,DreamCatalyst: Fast and High-Quality 3D Editing via Controlling Editability and Identity Preservation,"Jiwook Kim,Seonho Lee,Jaeyo Shin,Jiho Choi,Hyunjung Shim","Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D-consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \\textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

77,HAC++: Towards 100X Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Yihang Chen,Qianyi Wu,Weiyao Lin,Mehrtash Harandi,Jianfei Cai","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS. Our code is available at https://github.com/YihangChen-ee/HAC-plus.",January 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12255,
78,EdgeGaussians -- 3D Edge Mapping via Gaussian Splatting,"Kunal Chelani,Assia Benbihi,Torsten Sattler,Fredrik Kahl","With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our interpretive experiments and analysis aim to shed light on the effects of FDS on geometric accuracy and rendering quality, potentially providing readers with insights into its performance.

GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components.

This avatar is projected onto a stereoscopic, view-dependent 3D display, offering a more immersive and realistic simulated patient experience for pain assessment practice. However, there is no existing solution that dynamically predicts and projects interactive 3D facial avatars in real-time. To overcome this, we emphasize the need for a 3D display projection system that can project the facial avatar holographically, allowing users to interact with the avatar from any viewpoint.

82,WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting,"Chenghao Qian,Yuhu Guo,Wenjing Li,Gustav Markkula","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.",April 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591,

Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images.

Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal.

Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens.

To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning.

First, we propose a hybrid explicit representation that combines the advantages of two primitive-based efficient rendering techniques. UV-mapped 3D mesh is utilized to capture sharp and rich textures on smooth surfaces, while 3D Gaussian Splatting is employed to represent complex geometric structures. In the pipeline of modeling an avatar, after tracking parametric models based on captured multi-view RGB videos, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the texture and opacity map of mesh, as well as a set of 3D Gaussian splats localized and rigged onto the mesh facets. Specifically, we perform $\xce\xb1$-blending on the color and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffer from the rasterization results of mesh and 3DGS. This process involves the mesh and 3DGS adaptively fitting the captured visual information to outline a high-fidelity digital avatar.

Yet these methods often struggle to maintain the training and rendering efficiency, undermining the benefits of Gaussian Splatting techniques. In this paper, we introduce GlossGau, an efficient inverse rendering framework that reconstructs scenes with glossy surfaces while maintaining training and rendering speeds comparable to vanilla 3D-GS. Specifically, we explicitly model the surface normals, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters, as well as incident lights and use Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) to approximate the per-Gaussian Normal Distribution Function under the microfacet model. We utilize 2D Gaussian Splatting (2D-GS) as foundational primitives and apply regularization to significantly alleviate the normal estimation challenge encountered in related works.

In contrast, while sharing a similar image formation model with NeRF, 3DGS uses a hybrid rendering solution that builds on the strengths of volume rendering and primitive rasterization. A crucial benefit of 3DGS is its performance, achieved through a set of approximations, in many cases with respect to volumetric rendering theory. A naturally arising question is whether replacing these approximations with more principled volumetric rendering solutions can improve the quality of 3DGS. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the various approximations and assumptions used by the original 3DGS solution. We demonstrate that, while more accurate volumetric rendering can help for low numbers of primitives, the power of efficient optimization and the large number of Gaussians allows 3DGS to outperform volumetric rendering despite its approximations.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19318,
121,GStex: Per-Primitive Texturing of 2D Gaussian Splatting for Decoupled Appearance and Geometry Modeling,"Victor Rong,Jingxiang Chen,Sherwin Bahmani,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell","Gaussian splatting has demonstrated excellent performance for view synthesis and scene reconstruction. The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing.",September 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12954,
122,Generative Gaussian Splatting for Unbounded 3D City Generation,"Haozhe Xie,Zhaoxi Chen,Fangzhou Hong,Ziwei Liu","3D city generation with NeRF-based methods shows promising generation results but is computationally inefficient. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCity exhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18 FPS).",June 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06526,

Due to limited 3D labeled data, traditional supervised segmentation methods fall short in generalizing to unseen shapes and categories. Recently, the advancement in vision-language models' zero-shot abilities has brought a surge in open-world 3D segmentation methods. While these methods show promising results for 3D scenes or objects, they do not generalize well to 3D humans. In this paper, we present the first open-vocabulary segmentation method capable of handling 3D human. Our framework can segment the human category into desired fine-grained parts based on the textual prompt. We design a simple segmentation pipeline, leveraging SAM to generate multi-view proposals in 2D and proposing a novel HumanCLIP model to create unified embeddings for visual and textual inputs. Compared with existing pre-trained CLIP models, the HumanCLIP model yields more accurate embeddings for human-centric contents. We also design a simple-yet-effective MaskFusion module, which classifies and fuses multi-view features into 3D semantic masks without complex voting and grouping mechanisms. The design of decoupling mask proposals and text input also significantly boosts the efficiency of per-prompt inference. Experimental results on various 3D human datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation methods by a large margin. In addition, we show that our method can be directly applied to various 3D representations including meshes, point clouds, and 3D Gaussian Splatting.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19782,

However, adopting point clouds as 3D representation fails to fully capture the intricacies of the 3D world and exhibits a noticeable gap between the discrete points and the dense 2D pixels of images. To tackle this issue, we propose UniGS, integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into multi-modal pre-training to enhance the 3D representation. We first rely on the 3DGS representation to model the 3D world as a collection of 3D Gaussians with color and opacity, incorporating all the information of the 3D scene while establishing a strong connection with 2D images. Then, to achieve Language-Image-3D pertaining, UniGS starts with a pre-trained vision-language model to establish a shared visual and textual space through extensive real-world image-text pairs. Subsequently, UniGS employs a 3D encoder to align the optimized 3DGS with the Language-Image representations to learn unified multi-modal representations. To facilitate the extraction of global explicit 3D features by the 3D encoder and achieve better cross-modal alignment, we additionally introduce a novel Gaussian-Aware Guidance module that guides the learning of fine-grained representations of the 3D domain. Through extensive experiments across the Objaverse, ABO, MVImgNet and SUN RGBD datasets with zero-shot classification, text-driven retrieval and open-world understanding tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of UniGS in learning a more general and stronger aligned multi-modal representation. Specifically, UniGS achieves leading results across different 3D tasks with remarkable improvements over previous SOTA, Uni3D, including on zero-shot classification (+9.36%), text-driven retrieval (+4.3%) and open-world understanding (+7.92%).",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17860,
125,Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Monocular Dynamic Scene Rendering via Sparse Time-Variant Attribute Modeling,"Hanyang Kong,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang","Rendering dynamic scenes from monocular videos is a crucial yet challenging task. The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution to represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time steps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of Gaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model every Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions. In practice, the primary bottleneck in rendering speed for dynamic scenes is the number of Gaussians. In response, we introduce Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (EDGS), which represents dynamic scenes via sparse time-variant attribute modeling. Our approach formulates dynamic scenes using a sparse anchor-grid representation, with the motion flow of dense Gaussians calculated via a classical kernel representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised strategy to efficiently filter out anchors corresponding to static areas. Only anchors associated with deformable objects are input into MLPs to query time-variant attributes. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our EDGS significantly improves the rendering speed with superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20378,

Since tasks may require clarification or re-specification, it is necessary for the information in the map to be rich enough to enable generalization across a wide range of tasks. To effectively execute tasks specified in natural language, we propose a hierarchical representation built on language-embedded Gaussian splatting that enables both sparse semantic planning that lends itself to online operation and dense geometric representation for collision-free navigation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through real-world robot experiments conducted in both cluttered indoor and kilometer-scale outdoor environments, with a competitive ratio of about 60% against privileged baselines.

127,EndoPBR: Material and Lighting Estimation for Photorealistic Surgical Simulations via Physically-based Rendering,"John J. Han,Jie Ying Wu","The lack of labeled datasets in 3D vision for surgical scenes inhibits the development of robust 3D reconstruction algorithms in the medical domain. Despite the popularity of Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting in the general computer vision community, these systems have yet to find consistent success in surgical scenes due to challenges such as non-stationary lighting and non-Lambertian surfaces. As a result, the need for labeled surgical datasets continues to grow. In this work, we introduce a differentiable rendering framework for material and lighting estimation from endoscopic images and known geometry. Compared to previous approaches that model lighting and material jointly as radiance, we explicitly disentangle these scene properties for robust and photorealistic novel view synthesis. To disambiguate the training process, we formulate domain-specific properties inherent in surgical scenes. Specifically, we model the scene lighting as a simple spotlight and material properties as a bidirectional reflectance distribution function, parameterized by a neural network. By grounding color predictions in the rendering equation, we can generate photorealistic images at arbitrary camera poses. We evaluate our method with various sequences from the Colonoscopy 3D Video Dataset and show that our method produces competitive novel view synthesis results compared with other approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that synthetic data can be used to develop 3D vision algorithms by finetuning a depth estimation model with our rendered outputs.

We propose a novel hybrid representation, termed as HybridGS, using 2D Gaussians for transient objects per image and maintaining traditional 3D Gaussians for the whole static scenes. Note that, the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians. Our novel representation decomposes the scene from the perspective of fundamental viewpoint consistency, making it more reasonable. Additionally, we present a novel multi-view regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients and statics. Then, we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis across various settings.

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds).

This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GS-CPR obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GS-CPR enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation.

Traditional 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques rely on images captured from multiple viewpoints to achieve optimal performance, but this dependence limits their use in scenarios where only a single image is available. In this work, we introduce FlashDreamer, a novel approach for reconstructing a complete 3D scene from a single image, significantly reducing the need for multi-view inputs. Our approach leverages a pre-trained vision-language model to generate descriptive prompts for the scene, guiding a diffusion model to produce images from various perspectives, which are then fused to form a cohesive 3D reconstruction.

However, when applied to large-scale remote sensing scenes, 3D GS faces challenges: the point clouds generated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) are often sparse, and the inherent smoothing behavior of 3D GS leads to over-reconstruction in high-frequency regions, where have detailed textures and color variations. This results in the generation of large, opaque Gaussian ellipsoids that cause gradient artifacts. Moreover, the simultaneous optimization of both geometry and texture may lead to densification of Gaussian ellipsoids at incorrect geometric locations, resulting in artifacts in other views. To address these issues, we propose PSRGS, a progressive optimization scheme based on spectral residual maps. Specifically, we create a spectral residual significance map to separate low-frequency and high-frequency regions. In the low-frequency region, we apply depth-aware and depth-smooth losses to initialize the scene geometry with low threshold. For the high-frequency region, we use gradient features with higher threshold to split and clone ellipsoids, refining the scene. The sampling rate is determined by feature responses and gradient loss. Finally, we introduce a pre-trained network that jointly computes perceptual loss from multiple views, ensuring accurate restoration of high-frequency details in both Gaussian ellipsoids geometry and color.

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention for its high-quality rendering and fast inference speed. Yet, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, ensuring accurate geometry reconstruction remains difficult. Existing methods primarily focus on geometry regularization, with common approaches including primitive-based and dual-model frameworks. However, the former suffers from inherent conflicts between rendering and reconstruction, while the latter is computationally and storage-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose CarGS, a unified model leveraging Contribution-adaptive regularization to achieve simultaneous, high-quality rendering and surface reconstruction. The essence of our framework is learning adaptive contribution for Gaussian primitives by squeezing the knowledge from geometry regularization into a compact MLP. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-guided densification strategy with clues from both normals and Signed Distance Fields (SDF) to improve the capability of capturing high-frequency details. Our design improves the mutual learning of the two tasks, meanwhile its unified structure does not require separate models as in dual-model based approaches, guaranteeing efficiency.

To address this issue, we introduce an Inverse View Warping technique to create compact and high-quality images as supervision for the reconstruction of the out-of-path views, enabling high-quality rendering results for those views. For accurate and robust inverse view warping, a depth bootstrap strategy is proposed to obtain on-the-fly dense depth maps during the optimization process, overcoming the sparsity and incompleteness of LiDAR depth data. Our method achieves superior in-path and out-of-path reconstruction and rendering performance on the widely used Waymo Open dataset.

Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works.

Our work leverages the recent advancement in 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct the mesh sequence with temporal consistency from dynamic observations. Building on top of this representation, DG-Mesh recovers high-quality meshes from the Gaussian points and can track the mesh vertices over time, which enables applications such as texture editing on dynamic objects. We introduce the Gaussian-Mesh Anchoring, which encourages evenly distributed Gaussians, resulting better mesh reconstruction through mesh-guided densification and pruning on the deformed Gaussians. By applying cycle-consistent deformation between the canonical and the deformed space, we can project the anchored Gaussian back to the canonical space and optimize Gaussians across all time frames.

However, in this work, we reveal a significant security vulnerability that has been largely overlooked in 3DGS: the computation cost of training 3DGS could be maliciously tampered by poisoning the input data. By developing an attack named Poison-splat, we reveal a novel attack surface where the adversary can poison the input images to drastically increase the computation memory and time needed for 3DGS training, pushing the algorithm towards its worst computation complexity. In extreme cases, the attack can even consume all allocable memory, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) that disrupts servers, resulting in practical damages to real-world 3DGS service vendors. Such a computation cost attack is achieved by addressing a bi-level optimization problem through three tailored strategies: attack objective approximation, proxy model rendering, and optional constrained optimization. These strategies not only ensure the effectiveness of our attack but also make it difficult to defend with simple defensive measures.

To handle these, we develop novel linear relational abstractions that maintain precision while ensuring computational efficiency. These abstractions not only power our abstract rendering algorithm but also provide broadly applicable tools for other rendering problems. Our implementation, AbstractSplat, is optimized for scalability, handling up to 750k Gaussians while allowing users to balance memory and runtime through tile and batch-based computation. Compared to the only existing abstract image method for mesh-based scenes, AbstractSplat achieves 2-14x speedups while preserving precision. Our results demonstrate that continuous camera motion, rotations, and scene variations can be rigorously analyzed at scale, making abstract rendering a powerful tool for uncertainty-aware vision applications.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00308,

Over the past few years, the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has made significant progress in rendering quality but behaves poorly in run-time performance due to the low efficiency of volumetric rendering. Recently, methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown great potential in fast training and real-time rendering. However, they still suffer from artifacts caused by inaccurate geometry. To address these problems, we propose 2DGS-Avatar, a novel approach based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for modeling animatable clothed avatars with high-fidelity and fast training performance. Given monocular RGB videos as input, our method generates an avatar that can be driven by poses and rendered in real-time. Compared to 3DGS-based methods, our 2DGS-Avatar retains the advantages of fast training and rendering while also capturing detailed, dynamic, and photo-realistic appearances. We conduct abundant experiments on popular datasets such as AvatarRex and THuman4.0, demonstrating impressive performance in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02452,

In this paper, we present a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) experiment that aims to determine the perceived quality of 3D Gaussian avatars. Three factors were explored: Motion, LOD (i.e., #Gaussians), and the avatar height in Pixels (corresponding to the viewing distance). Participants viewed pairs of animated 3D Gaussian avatars and were tasked with choosing the most detailed one.

Consequently, thermal infrared images are employed to reconstruct 3D models that accurately reflect the temperature distribution of a scene, aiding in applications such as building monitoring and energy management. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on static 3D reconstruction for a single time period, overlooking the impact of environmental factors on thermal radiation and failing to predict or analyze temperature variations over time. To address these challenges, we propose the NTR-Gaussian method, which treats temperature as a form of thermal radiation, incorporating elements like convective heat transfer and radiative heat dissipation. Our approach utilizes neural networks to predict thermodynamic parameters such as emissivity, convective heat transfer coefficient, and heat capacity. By integrating these predictions, we can accurately forecast thermal temperatures at various times throughout a nighttime scene. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic dataset specifically for nighttime thermal imagery. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that NTR-Gaussian significantly outperforms comparison methods in thermal reconstruction, achieving a predicted temperature error within 1 degree Celsius.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03115,

Despite its advantages in rendering speed and image fidelity, 3DGS is limited by its significant storage and memory demands. These high demands make 3DGS impractical for mobile devices or headsets, reducing its applicability in important areas of computer graphics. To address these challenges and advance the practicality of 3DGS, this survey provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of compression and compaction techniques developed to make 3DGS more efficient. We classify existing methods into two categories: compression, which focuses on reducing file size, and compaction, which aims to minimize the number of Gaussians. Both methods aim to maintain or improve quality, each by minimizing its respective attribute: file size for compression and Gaussian count for compaction. We introduce the basic mathematical concepts underlying the analyzed methods, as well as key implementation details and design choices. Our report thoroughly discusses similarities and differences among the methods, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages. We establish a consistent framework for comparing the surveyed methods based on key performance metrics and datasets. Specifically, since these methods have been developed in parallel and over a short period of time, currently, no comprehensive comparison exists. This survey, for the first time, presents a unified framework to evaluate 3DGS compression techniques.

With vision-based navigation, when combined with pre-operative imaging data as priors, it is possible to recover position and pose of the endoscope without the need of additional sensors. In practice, however, aligning pre-operative and intra-operative domains is complicated by significant texture differences. Although methods such as style transfer can be used to address this issue, they require large datasets from both source and target domains with prolonged training times. This paper proposes an efficient domain transfer method based on stylized Gaussian splatting, only requiring a few of real images (10 images) with very fast training time. Specifically, the transfer process includes two phases. In the first phase, the 3D models reconstructed from CT scans are represented as differential Gaussian point clouds. In the second phase, only color appearance related parameters are optimized to transfer the style and preserve the visual content. A novel structure consistency loss is applied to latent features and depth levels to enhance the stability of the transferred images. Detailed validation was performed to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed method compared to that of the current state-of-the-art, highlighting the potential for intra-operative surgical navigation.",March 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10860,

However, recent methods often struggle to maintain local consistency in color and texture throughout stylized scenes, which is essential for maintaining aesthetic coherence. To solve this problem, this paper introduces ArtNVG, an innovative 3D stylization framework that efficiently generates stylized 3D scenes by leveraging reference style images. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), ArtNVG achieves rapid optimization and rendering while upholding high reconstruction quality. Our framework realizes high-quality 3D stylization by incorporating two pivotal techniques: Content-Style Separated Control and Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment. Content-Style Separated Control uses the CSGO model and the Tile ControlNet to decouple the content and style control, reducing risks of information leakage. Concurrently, Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment ensures consistency of local colors and textures across neighboring views, significantly improving visual quality.

Martinez Lema,Jianxiang Feng,Zhaopeng Chen,Alois Knoll","Learning dexterous manipulation from few-shot demonstrations is a significant yet challenging problem for advanced, human-like robotic systems. Dense distilled feature fields have addressed this challenge by distilling rich semantic features from 2D visual foundation models into the 3D domain. However, their reliance on neural rendering models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting results in high computational costs. In contrast, previous approaches based on sparse feature fields either suffer from inefficiencies due to multi-view dependencies and extensive training or lack sufficient grasp dexterity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Language-ENhanced Sparse Distilled Feature Field (LensDFF), which efficiently distills view-consistent 2D features onto 3D points using our novel language-enhanced feature fusion strategy, thereby enabling single-view few-shot generalization. Based on LensDFF, we further introduce a few-shot dexterous manipulation framework that integrates grasp primitives into the demonstrations to generate stable and highly dexterous grasps.

To address these limitations, we propose GaussianGraph, a novel framework that enhances 3DGS-based scene understanding by integrating adaptive semantic clustering and scene graph generation. We introduce a ""Control-Follow"" clustering strategy, which dynamically adapts to scene scale and feature distribution, avoiding feature compression and significantly improving segmentation accuracy. Additionally, we enrich scene representation by integrating object attributes and spatial relations extracted from 2D foundation models.

While recent efforts have mainly focused on improving model structures to compress data volume or reduce artifacts during zoom-in and zoom-out operations, they often overlook an underlying issue: training sampling deficiency. In zoomed-in views, Gaussian primitives can appear unregulated and distorted due to their dilation limitations and the insufficient availability of scale-specific training samples. Consequently, incorporating pseudo-details that ensure the completeness and alignment of the scene becomes essential. In this paper, we introduce a new training method that integrates diffusion models and multi-scale training using pseudo-ground-truth data. This approach not only notably mitigates the dilation and zoomed-in artifacts but also enriches reconstructed scenes with precise details out of existing scenarios.

Whereas existing methods only deal with either sparse views or low-resolution observations, they fail to handle such hybrid and complicated scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Sparse-view Super-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, dubbed S2Gaussian, that can reconstruct structure-accurate and detail-faithful 3D scenes with only sparse and low-resolution views. The S2Gaussian operates in a two-stage fashion. In the first stage, we initially optimize a low-resolution Gaussian representation with depth regularization and densify it to initialize the high-resolution Gaussians through a tailored Gaussian Shuffle Split operation. In the second stage, we refine the high-resolution Gaussians with the super-resolved images generated from both original sparse views and pseudo-views rendered by the low-resolution Gaussians. In which a customized blur-free inconsistency modeling scheme and a 3D robust optimization strategy are elaborately designed to mitigate multi-view inconsistency and eliminate erroneous updates caused by imperfect supervision.

Equipped with a multi-plane-based spatiotemporal encoder and a lightweight decoder, it predicts changes in color, coordinates, and shape of initialized Gaussians, given the time step. By leveraging temporal gradients, our model effectively captures temporal redundancy at negligible cost, significantly enhancing video representation efficiency.

In recent years, multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention. They overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However, most existing methods explore cross-modality correlations through feature-level or descriptor-level fusion, suffering from a lack of interpretability. Conversely, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new perspective on multimodal fusion by harmonizing different modalities into an explicit scene representation. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph convolution and transformer is designed to extract spatio-temporal features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition. Extensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance while maintaining solid generalization ability.

In this work, we address two critical yet overlooked issues in real-world sparse-input modeling: extrapolation and occlusion. To tackle these issues, we propose to use a reconstruction by generation pipeline that leverages learned priors from video diffusion models to provide plausible interpretations for regions outside the field of view or occluded. However, the generated sequences exhibit inconsistencies that do not fully benefit subsequent 3DGS modeling. To address the challenge of inconsistencies, we introduce a novel scene-grounding guidance based on rendered sequences from an optimized 3DGS, which tames the diffusion model to generate consistent sequences. This guidance is training-free and does not require any fine-tuning of the diffusion model. To facilitate holistic scene modeling, we also propose a trajectory initialization method. It effectively identifies regions that are outside the field of view and occluded. We further design a scheme tailored for 3DGS optimization with generated sequences.

Most existing methods, however, rely on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth for supervision, which are often difficult to be obtained in industrial applications and are sensitive to noise inputs. We propose viewing CAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to overcome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising perspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural images and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major significant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and natural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD sketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into representations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks. Next, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to ensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a customized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality reconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD sketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth.

However, reconstructing dynamic scenes such as complex human performances with long durations remains challenging. Prior efforts fall short of modeling a long-term sequence with drastic motions, frequent topology changes or interactions with props, and resort to segmenting the whole sequence into groups of frames that are processed independently, which undermines temporal stability and thereby leads to an unpleasant viewing experience and inefficient storage footprint. In view of this, we introduce EvolvingGS, a two-stage strategy that first deforms the Gaussian model to coarsely align with the target frame, and then refines it with minimal point addition/subtraction, particularly in fast-changing areas. Owing to the flexibility of the incrementally evolving representation, our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both per-frame and temporal quality metrics while maintaining fast rendering through its purely explicit representation. Moreover, by exploiting temporal coherence between successive frames, we propose a simple yet effective compression algorithm that achieves over 50x compression rate.

While the densification strategy used in per-scene 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) optimization can be adapted to the feed-forward models, it may not be ideally suited for generalized scenarios. In this paper, we propose Generative Densification, an efficient and generalizable method to densify Gaussians generated by feed-forward models. Unlike the 3D-GS densification strategy, which iteratively splits and clones raw Gaussian parameters, our method up-samples feature representations from the feed-forward models and generates their corresponding fine Gaussians in a single forward pass, leveraging the embedded prior knowledge for enhanced generalization.

Much research has been focused on reducing its storage requirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit the 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application calls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and entropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely unexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned image compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra correlation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work, termed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their rate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented according to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to capture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial autoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving as the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to leverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our CAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively skips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact on the rendering quality.

To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling.

We propose a novel video representation based on deformable 2D Gaussian splatting, dubbed D2GV, which aims to achieve three key objectives: 1) improved efficiency while delivering superior quality; 2) enhanced scalability and interpretability; and 3) increased friendliness for downstream tasks. Specifically, we initially divide the video sequence into fixed-length Groups of Pictures (GoP) to allow parallel training and linear scalability with video length. For each GoP, D2GV represents video frames by applying differentiable rasterization to 2D Gaussians, which are deformed from a canonical space into their corresponding timestamps. Notably, leveraging efficient CUDA-based rasterization, D2GV converges fast and decodes at speeds exceeding 400 FPS, while delivering quality that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art INRs. Moreover, we incorporate a learnable pruning and quantization strategy to streamline D2GV into a more compact representation. We demonstrate D2GV's versatility in tasks including video interpolation, inpainting and denoising, underscoring its potential as a promising solution for video representation.

169,Bayesian Fields: Task-driven Open-Set Semantic Gaussian Splatting,"Dominic Maggio,Luca Carlone","Open-set semantic mapping requires (i) determining the correct granularity to represent the scene (e.g., how should objects be defined), and (ii) fusing semantic knowledge across multiple 2D observations into an overall 3D reconstruction -ideally with a high-fidelity yet low-memory footprint. While most related works bypass the first issue by grouping together primitives with similar semantics (according to some manually tuned threshold), we recognize that the object granularity is task-dependent, and develop a task-driven semantic mapping approach. To address the second issue, current practice is to average visual embedding vectors over multiple views. Instead, we show the benefits of using a probabilistic approach based on the properties of the underlying visual-language foundation model, and leveraging Bayesian updating to aggregate multiple observations of the scene. The result is Bayesian Fields, a task-driven and probabilistic approach for open-set semantic mapping. To enable high-fidelity objects and a dense scene representation, Bayesian Fields uses 3D Gaussians which we cluster into task-relevant objects, allowing for both easy 3D object extraction and reduced memory usage.

Traditional NeRF steganography methods fail to address the explicit nature of 3DGS since its point cloud files are publicly accessible. Existing GS steganography solutions mitigate some issues but still struggle with reduced rendering fidelity, increased computational demands, and security flaws, especially in the security of the geometric structure of the visualized point cloud. To address these demands, we propose a SecureGS, a secure and efficient 3DGS steganography framework inspired by Scaffold-GS's anchor point design and neural decoding. SecureGS uses a hybrid decoupled Gaussian encryption mechanism to embed offsets, scales, rotations, and RGB attributes of the hidden 3D Gaussian points in anchor point features, retrievable only by authorized users through privacy-preserving neural networks. To further enhance security, we propose a density region-aware anchor growing and pruning strategy that adaptively locates optimal hiding regions without exposing hidden information.

However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-view consistency and strong generalization across diverse datasets.

To address this challenge, we propose T-3DGS, a novel framework that robustly filters out transient distractors during 3D reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting. Our framework consists of two steps. First, we employ an unsupervised classification network that distinguishes transient objects from static scene elements by leveraging their distinct training dynamics within the reconstruction process. Second, we refine these initial detections by integrating an off-the-shelf segmentation method with a bidirectional tracking module, which together enhance boundary accuracy and temporal coherence. Evaluations on both sparsely and densely captured video datasets demonstrate that T-3DGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstructions in challenging, real-world scenarios.",December 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00155,

A key reason for its success is the simplicity of representing scenes with sets of Gaussians, making it interpretable and adaptable. To enhance understanding beyond visual representation, recent approaches extend Gaussian Splatting with semantic vision-language features, enabling open-set tasks. Typically, these language features are aggregated from multiple 2D views, however, existing methods rely on cumbersome techniques, resulting in high computational costs and longer training times.  In this work, we show that the complicated pipelines for language 3D Gaussian Splatting are simply unnecessary. Instead, we follow a probabilistic formulation of Language Gaussian Splatting and apply Occam's razor to the task at hand, leading to a highly efficient weighted multi-view feature aggregation technique. Doing so offers us state-of-the-art results with a speed-up of two orders of magnitude without any compression, allowing for easy scene manipulation.

However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline, which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training. We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements on challenging robot scenes.

The technique of 3D Gaussian Splatting and its variants incorporate the strengths of both primitive-based and volumetric representations, achieving superior rendering quality. While 3D Geometric Scattering (3DGS) and its variants have advanced the field of 3D representation, they fall short in capturing the stochastic properties of non-local structural information during the training process. Additionally, the initialisation of spherical functions in 3DGS-based methods often fails to engage higher-order terms in early training rounds, leading to unnecessary computational overhead as training progresses. Furthermore, current 3DGS-based approaches require training on higher resolution images to render higher resolution outputs, significantly increasing memory demands and prolonging training durations. We introduce StructGS, a framework that enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for improved novel-view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. StructGS innovatively incorporates a patch-based SSIM loss, dynamic spherical harmonics initialisation and a Multi-scale Residual Network (MSRN) to address the above-mentioned limitations, respectively. Our framework significantly reduces computational redundancy, enhances detail capture and supports high-resolution rendering from low-resolution inputs.

Existing methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggle with inefficient light decoupling and structure-agnostic occlusion handling. To address these limitations, we propose NexusSplats, an approach tailored for efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction under complex lighting and occlusion conditions. In particular, NexusSplats leverages a hierarchical light decoupling strategy that performs centralized appearance learning, efficiently and effectively decoupling varying lighting conditions. Furthermore, a structure-aware occlusion handling mechanism is developed, establishing a nexus between 3D and 2D structures for fine-grained occlusion handling.

Recent advances leveraging implicit neural representation (INR) have achieved great progress by modeling coordinate-to-pixel mappings. However, the efficiency of these methods may suffer from repeated upsampling and decoding, while their reconstruction fidelity and quality are constrained by the intrinsic representational limitations of coordinate-based functions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ContinuousSR framework with a Pixel-to-Gaussian paradigm, which explicitly reconstructs 2D continuous HR signals from LR images using Gaussian Splatting. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming upsampling and decoding, enabling extremely fast arbitrary-scale super-resolution.

However, the challenge of natural-looking object insertion, where the object's appearance seamlessly matches the scene, remains unsolved. In this work, we propose a method, dubbed D3DR, for inserting a 3DGS-parametrized object into 3DGS scenes while correcting its lighting, shadows, and other visual artifacts to ensure consistency, a problem that has not been successfully addressed before. We leverage advances in diffusion models, which, trained on real-world data, implicitly understand correct scene lighting. After inserting the object, we optimize a diffusion-based Delta Denoising Score (DDS)-inspired objective to adjust its 3D Gaussian parameters for proper lighting correction. Utilizing diffusion model personalization techniques to improve optimization quality, our approach ensures seamless object insertion and natural appearance.

Specifically, we employ a 2D semantic segmentation foundation model to self-supervise the 4D semantic features of Gaussians, ensuring meaningful contextual embedding. Simultaneously, we track the temporal deformation of each Gaussian across adjacent frames. By aggregating and encoding both semantic and temporal deformation features, each Gaussian is equipped with cues for potential deformation compensation within 3D space, facilitating a more precise representation of dynamic scenes. Experimental results show that our method improves 4DGS's ability to capture fine details in dynamic scene rendering for autonomous driving and outperforms other self-supervised methods in 4D reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

While the selection of 2D images capturing the scene of interest is crucial for the proper initialization and training of GS, hence markedly affecting the rendering performance, prior works rely on passively and typically densely selected 2D images. In contrast, this paper proposes `ActiveInitSplat', a novel framework for active selection of training images for proper initialization and training of GS. ActiveInitSplat relies on density and occupancy criteria of the resultant 3D scene representation from the selected 2D images, to ensure that the latter are captured from diverse viewpoints leading to better scene coverage and that the initialized Gaussian functions are well aligned with the actual 3D structure.

GS-based rendering for 3D content has gained considerable attention recently. However, there has been limited exploration in directly generating 3D Gaussians compared to traditional generative modeling approaches. The main challenge lies in the complex data structure of GS represented by discrete point clouds with multiple channels. To overcome this challenge, we propose employing the triplane representation, which allows us to represent Gaussian Splatting as an image-like continuous field. This representation effectively encodes both the geometry and texture information, enabling smooth transformation back to Gaussian point clouds and rendering into images by a TriRenderer, with only 2D supervisions. The proposed TriRenderer is fully differentiable, so that the rendering loss can supervise both texture and geometry encoding. Furthermore, the triplane representation can be compressed using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which can subsequently be utilized in latent diffusion to generate 3D objects. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed generation framework can produce high-quality 3D object geometry and rendering results in the text-to-3D task.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06900,

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization.

In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices.  Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions.

From the signal processing perspective, representing details usually needs more Gaussians with relatively smaller scales. However, 3DGS currently lacks an explicit constraint linking the density and scale of 3D Gaussians across the domain, leading to 3DGS using improper-scale Gaussians to express frequency information, resulting in the loss of accuracy. In this paper, we propose to establish a direct relation between density and scale through the reparameterization of the scaling parameters and ensure the consistency between them via explicit constraints (i.e., density responds well to changes in frequency). Furthermore, we develop a frequency-aware density control strategy, consisting of densification and deletion, to improve representation quality with fewer Gaussians. A dynamic threshold encourages densification in high-frequency regions, while a scale-based filter deletes Gaussians with improper scale.

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 3DGS and related novel view synthesis methods under out-of-distribution (OOD) test camera scenarios. By creating diverse test cases with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that most existing methods, including those incorporating various regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to OOD views. To address this limitation, we introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model specifically designed to operate on Gaussian splats. SplatFormer takes as input an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views and refines it in a single forward pass, effectively removing potential artifacts in OOD test views. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of point transformers directly on 3DGS sets, surpassing the limitations of previous multi-scene training methods, which could handle only a restricted number of input views during inference.

Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications. To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and world models. DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by integrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to imagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences of robot actions thanks to its compositionality. We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents.

The key challenge in steganography is ensuring imperceptibility while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. However, existing methods often suffer from detectability risks and utilize only suboptimal 3DGS features, limiting their full potential. We propose a novel end-to-end key-secured 3D steganography framework (KeySS) that jointly optimizes a 3DGS model and a key-secured decoder for secret reconstruction. Our approach reveals that Gaussian features contribute unequally to secret hiding. The framework incorporates a key-controllable mechanism enabling multi-secret hiding and unauthorized access prevention, while systematically exploring optimal feature update to balance fidelity and security. To rigorously evaluate steganographic imperceptibility beyond conventional 2D metrics, we introduce 3D-Sinkhorn distance analysis, which quantifies distributional differences between original and steganographic Gaussian parameters in the representation space.

BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. The proposed primitives close the rendering quality gap between 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enabling the accurate extraction of 3D mesh as in the 2DGS framework. Additionally, the explicit nature of planar primitives enables the use of the ray-tracing effects in rasterization. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, enabling an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in the storage space of the model up to x17 times compared to 3DGS. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360.

In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process.

192,Efficient Perspective-Correct 3D Gaussian Splatting Using Hybrid Transparency,"Florian Hahlbohm,Fabian Friederichs,Tim Weyrich,Linus Franke,Moritz Kappel,Susana Castillo,Marc Stamminger,Martin Eisemann,Marcus Magnor","3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) have proven a versatile rendering primitive, both for inverse rendering as well as real-time exploration of scenes. In these applications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, be it for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-free fly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality approximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level, in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate approach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions, thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies at a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these two components can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. In combination, they achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher frame rates, 2$\\times$ faster optimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifacts compared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.",October 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08129,
193,SOGS: Second-Order Anchor for Advanced 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Jiahui Zhang,Fangneng Zhan,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu","Anchor-based 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) exploits anchor features in 3D Gaussian prediction, which has achieved impressive 3D rendering quality with reduced Gaussian redundancy. On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07476,

However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms 3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

We present 7D Gaussian Splatting (7DGS), a unified framework representing scene elements as seven-dimensional Gaussians spanning position (3D), time (1D), and viewing direction (3D). Our key contribution is an efficient conditional slicing mechanism that transforms 7D Gaussians into view- and time-conditioned 3D Gaussians, maintaining compatibility with existing 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines while enabling joint optimization.

Widely adopted approaches supervise complex interactions with additional masks and control signal annotations, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an annotation guidance-free method, dubbed FreeGaussian, that mathematically derives dynamic Gaussian motion from optical flow and camera motion using novel dynamic Gaussian constraints. By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic control, our method enables self-supervised optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state with a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling.

Existing automatic rigging tools face several limitations, including the necessity for manual annotations, rigid skeleton topologies, and limited generalization across diverse shapes and poses. An alternative approach is to generate animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However, this method often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human shapes. To address these issues, we present Make-It-Animatable, a novel data-driven method to make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second, regardless of its shapes and poses. Our unified framework generates high-quality blend weights, bones, and pose transformations. By incorporating a particle-based shape autoencoder, our approach supports various 3D representations, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splats. Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a structure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even for characters with non-standard skeleton structures.

The key challenge of this task is learning a robust 3D-aware representation without multi-view or dynamic data, while ensuring consistent texture and geometry across different viewpoints. Although some baseline methods are capable of 3D-aware generation, the quality of the generated images still lags behind state-of-the-art 2D generation approaches, which excel in producing high-quality, detailed images. To address this severe limitation, we propose a novel feed-forward pipeline based on pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting, coined as F3D-Gaus, which can produce more realistic and reliable 3D renderings from monocular inputs. In addition, we introduce a self-supervised cycle-aggregative constraint to enforce cross-view consistency in the learned 3D representation. This training strategy naturally allows aggregation of multiple aligned Gaussian primitives and significantly alleviates the interpolation limitations inherent in single-view pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting. Furthermore, we incorporate video model priors to perform geometry-aware refinement, enhancing the generation of fine details in wide-viewpoint scenarios and improving the model's capability to capture intricate 3D textures.

However, when applied to large-scale street scenes, existing methods suffer from rapidly escalating per-viewpoint reconstruction costs as scene size increases, leading to significant computational overhead. After revisiting the conventional pipeline, we identify three key factors accounting for this issue: unnecessary local-to-global transformations, excessive 3D-to-2D projections, and inefficient rendering of distant content. To address these challenges, we propose S3R-GS, a 3DGS framework that Streamlines the pipeline for large-scale Street Scene Reconstruction, effectively mitigating these limitations. Moreover, most existing street 3DGS methods rely on ground-truth 3D bounding boxes to separate dynamic and static components, but 3D bounding boxes are difficult to obtain, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an alternative solution with 2D boxes, which are easier to annotate or can be predicted by off-the-shelf vision foundation models. Such designs together make S3R-GS readily adapt to large, in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S3R-GS enhances rendering quality and significantly accelerates reconstruction.

However, its substantial data size poses a significant challenge for practical applications. While many compression techniques have been proposed, they fail to efficiently utilize existing bitstreams in on-demand applications due to their lack of progressivity, leading to a waste of resource. To address this issue, we propose PCGS (Progressive Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting), which adaptively controls both the quantity and quality of Gaussians (or anchors) to enable effective progressivity for on-demand applications. Specifically, for quantity, we introduce a progressive masking strategy that incrementally incorporates new anchors while refining existing ones to enhance fidelity. For quality, we propose a progressive quantization approach that gradually reduces quantization step sizes to achieve finer modeling of Gaussian attributes. Furthermore, to compact the incremental bitstreams, we leverage existing quantization results to refine probability prediction, improving entropy coding efficiency across progressive levels. Overall, PCGS achieves progressivity while maintaining compression performance comparable to SoTA non-progressive methods.

Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts.

FPGS, stylizes large-scale 3D scenes with arbitrary, multiple style reference images without additional optimization while preserving multi-view consistency and real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussians. Prior arts required tedious per-style optimization or time-consuming per-scene training stage and were limited to small-scale 3D scenes. FPGS efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D feature field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPGS supports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPGS also preserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space.

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method.

We take a bottom-up approach in deriving FAST-Splat, dismantling the limitations of closed-set semantic distillation to enable open-set (open-vocabulary) semantic distillation. Ultimately, this key approach enables FAST-Splat to provide precise semantic object localization results, even when prompted with ambiguous user-provided natural-language queries. Further, by exploiting the explicit form of the Gaussian Splatting scene representation to the fullest extent, FAST-Splat retains the remarkable training and rendering speeds of Gaussian Splatting. Precisely, while existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods distill semantics into a separate neural field or utilize neural models for dimensionality reduction, FAST-Splat directly augments each Gaussian with specific semantic codes, preserving the training, rendering, and memory-usage advantages of Gaussian Splatting over neural field methods. These Gaussian-specific semantic codes, together with a hash-table, enable semantic similarity to be measured with open-vocabulary user prompts and further enable FAST-Splat to respond with unambiguous semantic object labels and $3$D masks, unlike prior methods. In experiments, we demonstrate that FAST-Splat is 6x to 8x faster to train, achieves between 18x to 51x faster rendering speeds, and requires about 6x smaller GPU memory, compared to the best-competing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods.

However, 3DGS tends to overfit when trained with sparse views, limiting its generalization to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we address this overfitting issue by introducing Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS). We achieve self-ensembling by incorporating an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy during training. A $\\mathbf\xce\x94$-model and a $\\mathbf\xce\xa3$-model are jointly trained on the available images. The $\\mathbf\xce\x94$-model is dynamically perturbed based on rendering uncertainty across training steps, generating diverse perturbed models with negligible computational overhead.

Given a set of multi-view RGB images of human-object interactions, our method reconstructs animatable templates of the human and object as separate sets of Gaussians simultaneously. Different from existing work, which focuses on human reconstruction and ignores objects as background, our method explicitly reconstructs both humans and objects, thereby allowing for controllable renderings of novel human object interactions in different poses from novel-camera viewpoints. During reconstruction, we constrain the Gaussians that generate rendered images to be a linear function of a set of canonical Gaussians. By simply changing the parameters of the linear deformation functions after training, our method can generate renderings of novel human-object interaction in novel poses from novel camera viewpoints. We learn the 3D Gaussian properties of the canonical Gaussians on the underlying 2D manifold of the canonical human and object templates. This in turns requires a canonical object template with a fixed UV unwrapping. To define such an object template, we use a feature based representation to track the object across the multi-view sequence. We further propose an occlusion aware photometric loss that allows for reconstructions under significant occlusions. Several experiments on two human-object datasets - BEHAVE and DNA-Rendering - demonstrate that our method allows for high-quality reconstruction of human and object templates under significant occlusion and the synthesis of controllable renderings of novel human-object interactions in novel human poses from novel camera views.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09342,

However, its rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates significantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the model's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2) challenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution changes and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view generation--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than those in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach for close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model with self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we leverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to enhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to progressively expand the ``trust regions'' of the 3DGS model and update a set of reference views for See3D.

Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20X while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods.

However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09464,

At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art NVS methods across different evaluation settings. Our results show that current NVS methods are prone to overfitting to training views.

Additionally, the global tone mapper used in existing methods can impede the learning of both HDR and LDR representations. To address these challenges, we present GaussHDR, which unifies 3D and 2D local tone mapping through 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we design a residual local tone mapper for both 3D and 2D tone mapping that accepts an additional context feature as input. We then propose combining the dual LDR rendering results from both 3D and 2D local tone mapping at the loss level.

All visual tokens are concatenated with additional inserted learnable camera tokens. The obtained tokens then fully communicate with each other within a tailored transformer decoder. The camera tokens causally aggregate features from visual tokens of different views, and further modulate them frame-wisely to inject view-dependent features. 3D Gaussian splats and camera pose parameters can then be estimated via different prediction heads. Experiments show that VicaSplat surpasses baseline methods for multi-view inputs, and achieves comparable performance to prior two-view approaches.

Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency.

To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistency Gaussian Splatting for the domain of Robust Surface Reconstruction (\\textbf{MVGSR}), which takes advantage of lightweight Gaussian models and a {heuristics-guided distractor masking} strategy for robust surface reconstruction in non-static environments. Compared to existing methods that rely on MLPs for distractor segmentation strategies, our approach separates distractors from static scene elements by comparing multi-view feature consistency, allowing us to obtain precise distractor masks early in training. Furthermore, we introduce a pruning measure based on multi-view contributions to reset transmittance, effectively reducing floating artifacts. Finally, a multi-view consistency loss is applied to achieve high-quality performance in surface reconstruction tasks.

Our key contribution is separating the view synthesis process into two tasks of reconstructing visible regions and hallucinating missing regions, and introducing two personalized diffusion models, each tailored to one of these tasks. Specifically, one model ('repair') takes a rendered image as input and predicts the corresponding high-quality image, which in turn is used as a pseudo ground truth image to constrain the optimization. The other model ('inpainting') primarily focuses on hallucinating details in unobserved areas. To integrate these models effectively, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy: the first stage reconstructs visible areas using the repair model, and the second stage reconstructs missing regions with the inpainting model while ensuring coherence through further optimization. Moreover, we augment the optimization with a novel Gaussian initialization method that obtains per-image depth by combining 3D-consistent and smooth depth with highly detailed relative depth. We demonstrate that by separating the process into two tasks and addressing them with the repair and inpainting models, we produce results with detailed textures in both visible and missing regions that outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse set of scenes with extremely sparse inputs.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10860,

In contrast to navigation in discrete environments with predefined trajectories, VLN in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents greater challenges, as the agent is free to navigate any unobstructed location and is more vulnerable to visual occlusions or blind spots. Recent approaches have attempted to address this by imagining future environments, either through predicted future visual images or semantic features, rather than relying solely on current observations. However, these RGB-based and feature-based methods lack intuitive appearance-level information or high-level semantic complexity crucial for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable 3DGS-based pre-training paradigm, called UnitedVLN, which enables agents to better explore future environments by unitedly rendering high-fidelity 360 visual images and semantic features. UnitedVLN employs two key schemes: search-then-query sampling and separate-then-united rendering, which facilitate efficient exploitation of neural primitives, helping to integrate both appearance and semantic information for more robust navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnitedVLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing VLN-CE benchmarks.",November 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16053,
240,A Hierarchical Compression Technique for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression,"He Huang,Wenjie Huang,Qi Yang,Yiling Xu,Zhu li","3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates excellent rendering quality and generation speed in novel view synthesis. However, substantial data size poses challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC) technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the state-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.",November 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06976,

However, they exhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to the sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision. To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12535,

Moreover, our pipeline incorporates techniques such as online loop closure and global bundle adjustment to achieve a dense and precise global trajectory. We model the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images and minimize the error between the observed blurry images and rendered blurry images obtained by averaging sharp virtual sub-frame images. Additionally, by utilizing a monocular depth estimator alongside the online deformation of Gaussians, we ensure precise mapping and enhanced image deblurring.

Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion).

While previous studies have leveraged visual perception to estimate spatial acoustics, the combined use of surface normal and structural details from 3D representations in acoustic modeling has been underexplored. Given their direct impact on sound wave reflections and propagation, surface normals should be jointly modeled with structural details to achieve accurate spatial acoustics. In this paper, we propose a surface-enhanced geometry-aware approach for NVAS to improve spatial acoustic modeling. To achieve this, we exploit geometric priors, such as image, depth map, surface normals, and point clouds obtained using a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based framework. We introduce a dual cross-attention-based transformer integrating geometrical constraints into frequency query to understand the surroundings of the emitter. Additionally, we design a ConvNeXt-based spectral features processing network called Spectral Refinement Network (SRN) to synthesize realistic binaural audio.

However, achieving rate-distortion-optimized compression of 3DGS representations for transmission and/or storage applications remains a challenge. CAT-3DGS introduces a context-adaptive triplane hyperprior for end-to-end optimized compression, delivering state-of-the-art coding performance. Despite this, it requires prolonged training and decoding time. To address these limitations, we propose CAT-3DGS Pro, an enhanced version of CAT-3DGS that improves both compression performance and computational efficiency. First, we introduce a PCA-guided vector-matrix hyperprior, which replaces the triplane-based hyperprior to reduce redundant parameters. To achieve a more balanced rate-distortion trade-off and faster encoding, we propose an alternate optimization strategy (A-RDO). Additionally, we refine the sampling rate optimization method in CAT-3DGS, leading to significant improvements in rate-distortion performance.

The first is to adaptively and explicitly allocate sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details with $65536^3$ grid resolution while achieving high rendering frame rates. Second, we customize a rasterizer for efficient adaptive sparse voxels rendering. We render voxels in the correct depth order by using ray direction-dependent Morton ordering, which avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel model by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results.

However, the reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed depth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit surface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to recover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our approach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces with intricate details.

In response to this limitation, we present LAyered Gaussian Avatar (LAGA), a carefully designed framework enabling the creation of high-fidelity decomposable avatars with diverse garments. By decoupling garments from avatar, our framework empowers users to conviniently edit avatars at the garment level. Our approach begins by modeling the avatar using a set of Gaussian points organized in a layered structure, where each layer corresponds to a specific garment or the human body itself. To generate high-quality garments for each layer, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for diverse garment generation and a novel dual-SDS loss function to maintain coherence between the generated garments and avatar components, including the human body and other garments. Moreover, we introduce three regularization losses to guide the movement of Gaussians for garment transfer, allowing garments to be freely transferred to various avatars.

Video diffusion models generate impressive videos but cannot directly synthesize 3D representations, i.e., lack 3D consistency in the generated sequences. In addition, directly training generative 3D models is challenging due to a lack of 3D training data at scale. In this work, we present Generative Gaussian Splatting (GGS) -- a novel approach that integrates a 3D representation with a pre-trained latent video diffusion model. Specifically, our model synthesizes a feature field parameterized via 3D Gaussian primitives. The feature field is then either rendered to feature maps and decoded into multi-view images, or directly upsampled into a 3D radiance field. We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets for scene synthesis, RealEstate10K and ScanNet+, and find that our proposed GGS model significantly improves both the 3D consistency of the generated multi-view images, and the quality of the generated 3D scenes over all relevant baselines. Compared to a similar model without 3D representation, GGS improves FID on the generated 3D scenes by ~20% on both RealEstate10K and ScanNet+.

Specifically, 1) We propose a CLIP-guided pipeline for optimizing the message decoder with minimal costs. The key objective is to achieve high-accuracy extraction by leveraging CLIP's aligning capability and rich representations, demonstrating exceptional capacity and efficiency. 2) We tailor a Spherical-Harmonic-aware (SH-aware) Message Embedding module for 3DGS, seamlessly embedding messages into the SH features of each 3D Gaussian while preserving the original 3D structure. This enables watermarking 3DGS assets with minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the watermarks from the model files, meeting the demands for invisibility and security. 3) We present an Anti-distortion Message Extraction module to improve robustness against various distortions.

To adapt 3DGS for dynamic content, deformable 3DGS incorporates temporally deformable primitives with learnable latent embeddings to capture complex motions.

Existing methods rely on direct matching for end-to-end lifting, yielding inferior results; or employ a two-stage solution constrained by complex pre- or post-processing. In this work, we design a new end-to-end object-aware lifting approach, named Unified-Lift that provides accurate 3D segmentation based on the 3D Gaussian representation. To start, we augment each Gaussian point with an additional Gaussian-level feature learned using a contrastive loss to encode instance information. Importantly, we introduce a learnable object-level codebook to account for individual objects in the scene for an explicit object-level understanding and associate the encoded object-level features with the Gaussian-level point features for segmentation predictions. While promising, achieving effective codebook learning is non-trivial and a naive solution leads to degraded performance.

Due to its efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis capabilities, it has been widely adopted in many research fields and applications. Nevertheless, 3DGS still faces challenges to properly manage the number of Gaussian primitives that are used during scene reconstruction. Following the adaptive density control (ADC) mechanism of 3D Gaussian Splatting, new Gaussians in under-reconstructed regions are created, while Gaussians that do not contribute to the rendering quality are pruned. We observe that those criteria for densifying and pruning Gaussians can sometimes lead to worse rendering by introducing artifacts. We especially observe under-reconstructed background or overfitted foreground regions. To encounter both problems, we propose three new improvements to the adaptive density control mechanism. Those include a correction for the scene extent calculation that does not only rely on camera positions, an exponentially ascending gradient threshold to improve training convergence, and significance-aware pruning strategy to avoid background artifacts. With these adaptions, we show that the rendering quality improves while using the same number of Gaussians primitives.

To improve fidelity, we extend standard 3DGS attributes with implicit geometry and appearance embeddings for finer non-rigid motion modeling while preserving the static hand characteristic modeled by original 3DGS attributes.

We find that the scale and rotation coefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types. Specifically, wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian ellipsoids, while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids. Additionally, the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency characteristics of objects. As a result, ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D classification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify the effectiveness of GS point cloud input, we construct the first real-world GS point cloud dataset in the community, which includes 20 categories with 200 objects in each category.

Capturing dynamic scenes with handheld monocular cameras, for instance, typically involves simultaneous movement of both the camera and objects within a single exposure. This combined motion frequently results in image blur that existing methods cannot adequately handle. To address these challenges, we introduce BARD-GS, a novel approach for robust dynamic scene reconstruction that effectively handles blurry inputs and imprecise camera poses. Our method comprises two main components: 1) camera motion deblurring and 2) object motion deblurring. By explicitly decomposing motion blur into camera motion blur and object motion blur and modeling them separately, we achieve significantly improved rendering results in dynamic regions. In addition, we collect a real-world motion blur dataset of dynamic scenes to evaluate our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BARD-GS effectively reconstructs high-quality dynamic scenes under realistic conditions, significantly outperforming existing methods.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15835,

To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15855,

However, despite their success in producing high-quality images for viewpoints similar to those seen during training, they struggle when generating detailed images from viewpoints that significantly deviate from the training set, particularly in close-up views. The primary challenge stems from the lack of specific training data for close-up views, leading to the inability of current methods to render these views accurately. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pseudo-label-based learning strategy. This approach leverages pseudo-labels derived from existing training data to provide targeted supervision across a wide range of close-up viewpoints.

However, existing division methods are occlusion-agnostic, meaning that each region may contain areas with severe occlusions. As a result, the cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average contribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on their positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in such regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution, facilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a region-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which culls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a technique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves superior reconstruction results with faster rendering speed compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

While conventional methods require per-scene optimization, more recently several feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate pixel-aligned Gaussian representations with a learnable network, which are generalizable to different scenes. However, these methods simply combine pixel-aligned Gaussians from multiple views as scene representations, thereby leading to artifacts and extra memory cost without fully capturing the relations of Gaussians from different images. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Graph Network (GGN) to generate efficient and generalizable Gaussian representations. Specifically, we construct Gaussian Graphs to model the relations of Gaussian groups from different views. To support message passing at Gaussian level, we reformulate the basic graph operations over Gaussian representations, enabling each Gaussian to benefit from its connected Gaussian groups with Gaussian feature fusion. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian pooling layer to aggregate various Gaussian groups for efficient representations. We conduct experiments on the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs).

271,1000+ FPS 4D Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Rendering,"Yuheng Yuan,Qiuhong Shen,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang","4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently gained considerable attention as a method for reconstructing dynamic scenes. Despite achieving superior quality, 4DGS typically requires substantial storage and suffers from slow rendering speed. In this work, we delve into these issues and identify two key sources of temporal redundancy. (Q1) \\textbf{Short-Lifespan Gaussians}: 4DGS uses a large portion of Gaussians with short temporal span to represent scene dynamics, leading to an excessive number of Gaussians. (Q2) \\textbf{Inactive Gaussians}: When rendering, only a small subset of Gaussians contributes to each frame. Despite this, all Gaussians are processed during rasterization, resulting in redundant computation overhead. To address these redundancies, we present \\textbf{4DGS-1K}, which runs at over 1000 FPS on modern GPUs. For Q1, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Variation Score, a new pruning criterion that effectively removes short-lifespan Gaussians while encouraging 4DGS to capture scene dynamics using Gaussians with longer temporal spans. For Q2, we store a mask for active Gaussians across consecutive frames, significantly reducing redundant computations in rendering. Compared to vanilla 4DGS, our method achieves a $41\\times$ reduction in storage and $9\\times$ faster rasterization speed on complex dynamic scenes, while maintaining comparable visual quality.

Instead of removing dynamic objects as distractors and reconstructing only static environments, this paper proposes an efficient architecture that incrementally tracks camera poses and establishes the 4D Gaussian radiance fields in unknown scenarios by using a sequence of RGB-D images. First, by generating motion masks, we obtain static and dynamic priors for each pixel. To eliminate the influence of static scenes and improve the efficiency on learning the motion of dynamic objects, we classify the Gaussian primitives into static and dynamic Gaussian sets, while the sparse control points along with an MLP is utilized to model the transformation fields of the dynamic Gaussians. To more accurately learn the motion of dynamic Gaussians, a novel 2D optical flow map reconstruction algorithm is designed to render optical flows of dynamic objects between neighbor images, which are further used to supervise the 4D Gaussian radiance fields along with traditional photometric and geometric constraints.

However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities.

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed.

To address these challenges, we introduce DroneSplat, a novel framework designed for robust 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild drone imagery. Our method adaptively adjusts masking thresholds by integrating local-global segmentation heuristics with statistical approaches, enabling precise identification and elimination of dynamic distractors in static scenes.

Some methods leverage 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) to represent the entire scene, but they treat static and dynamic objects uniformly, leading to unnecessary updates for static elements and ultimately degrading reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose UrbanGS, which leverages 2D semantic maps and an existing dynamic Gaussian approach to distinguish static objects from the scene, enabling separate processing of definite static and potentially dynamic elements. Specifically, for definite static regions, we enforce global consistency to prevent unintended changes in dynamic Gaussian and introduce a K-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based regularization to improve local coherence on low-textured ground surfaces.

However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods.

The 3D Gaussian Splatting technique, alongside its derivatives, integrates the advantages of primitive-based and volumetric representations to deliver top-tier rendering quality and efficiency. Despite these advancements, the method tends to generate excessive redundant noisy Gaussians overfitted to every training view, which degrades the rendering quality.

To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFocus, an innovative approach that incorporates a patch attention algorithm to refine rendering quality and implements a Gaussian constraints strategy to minimize redundancy. Moreover, we propose a subdivision reconstruction strategy for large-scale scenes, dividing them into smaller, manageable blocks for individual training. Our results indicate that GaussianFocus significantly reduces unnecessary Gaussians and enhances rendering quality, surpassing existing State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods.

Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian.

We place paired mirrors on nested pyramid surfaces for capturing surrounding multi-view images in a single shot. Our mirror design is customizable based on the size of the scene for optimized view coverage. We use the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

312,HoGS: Unified Near and Far Object Reconstruction via Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting,"Xinpeng Liu,Zeyi Huang,Fumio Okura,Yasuyuki Matsushita","Novel view synthesis has demonstrated impressive progress recently, with 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) offering efficient training time and photorealistic real-time rendering. However, reliance on Cartesian coordinates limits 3DGS's performance on distant objects, which is important for reconstructing unbounded outdoor environments. We found that, despite its ultimate simplicity, using homogeneous coordinates, a concept on the projective geometry, for the 3DGS pipeline remarkably improves the rendering accuracies of distant objects. We therefore propose Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting (HoGS) incorporating homogeneous coordinates into the 3DGS framework, providing a unified representation for enhancing near and distant objects. HoGS effectively manages both expansive spatial positions and scales particularly in outdoor unbounded environments by adopting projective geometry principles. Experiments show that HoGS significantly enhances accuracy in reconstructing distant objects while maintaining high-quality rendering of nearby objects, along with fast training speed and real-time rendering capability.

Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

Directly applying static methods to understand dynamic scenes will fail to capture the temporal features. Few works focus on dynamic scene understanding based on Gaussian Splatting, since once the same update strategy is employed for both dynamic and static parts, regardless of the distinction and interaction between Gaussians, significant artifacts and noise appear. We propose Dual-Hierarchical Optimization (DHO), which consists of Hierarchical Gaussian Flow and Hierarchical Gaussian Guidance in a divide-and-conquer manner.

Existing methods, which optimize per-image appearance and transient occlusion through implicit neural networks from dense training views (approximately 1000 images), struggle to perform effectively under sparse input conditions, resulting in noticeable artifacts. To this end, we propose SparseGS-W, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables the reconstruction of complex outdoor scenes and handles occlusions and appearance changes with as few as five training images. We leverage geometric priors and constrained diffusion priors to compensate for the lack of multi-view information from extremely sparse input. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Constrained Novel-View Enhancement module to iteratively improve the quality of rendered novel views during the Gaussian optimization process. Furthermore, we propose an Occlusion Handling module, which flexibly removes occlusions utilizing the inherent high-quality inpainting capability of constrained diffusion priors. Both modules are capable of extracting appearance features from any user-provided reference image, enabling flexible modeling of illumination-consistent scenes.

This leads to a need for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we propose Vivar, a novel system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for AR visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This approach accurately reflects value changes in multi-modal sensor information, ensuring that sensor variations are properly shown in visualization outcomes. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise.

To account for the ill-posed nature of the setting, existing methods use deformation models with statistical, neural, or physical priors. They also predominantly rely on nonadaptive discrete surface representations (e.g. polygonal meshes), perform frame-by-frame optimisation leading to error propagation, and suffer from poor gradients of the mesh-based differentiable renderers. Consequently, fine surface details such as cloth wrinkles are often not recovered with the desired accuracy. In response to these limitations, we propose ThinShell-SfT, a new method for non-rigid 3D tracking that represents a surface as an implicit and continuous spatiotemporal neural field. We incorporate continuous thin shell physics prior based on the Kirchhoff-Love model for spatial regularisation, which starkly contrasts the discretised alternatives of earlier works. Lastly, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to differentiably render the surface into image space and optimise the deformations based on analysis-bysynthesis principles.

We propose to quantify information gain in 3D-GS by reformulating the problem through the lens of optimal experimental design, which is a classical solution widely used in literature. By restructuring information quantification of 3D-GS through optimal experimental design, we arrive at multiple solutions, of which T-Optimality and D-Optimality perform the best quantitatively and qualitatively as measured on two popular datasets.

To achieve our goal, we propose a view augmentation framework to guide training through a coarse-to-fine process. At the coarse stage, we reduce rendering artifacts due to insufficient view coverage by introducing a regularization strategy at both appearance and geometry levels. At the fine stage, we generate reliable view priors to provide further training guidance. To this end, we incorporate an occlusion awareness into the view prior generation process, and refine the view priors with the aid of coarse stage output. We call our framework Enhanced View Prior Guidance for Splatting (EVPGS). To comprehensively evaluate EVPGS on the EVS task, we collect a real-world dataset called Merchandise3D dedicated to the EVS scenario.

Unlike existing feed-forward, pixel-aligned 3DGS methods, which often suffer from issues like multi-view inconsistencies and duplicated content, our approach predicts 3D Gaussians across multiple frames within a unified volume using a 3D convolutional network. This is achieved by initializing 3D Gaussians with noisy depth predictions, and then refining their geometric properties in 3D space and predicting color based on 2D textures.

Nevertheless, the unorganized shape of 3DGS leads to difficulties in compression. To formulate unstructured attributes into normative distribution, we propose a well-structured tri-plane to encode Gaussian attributes, leveraging the distribution of attributes for compression. To exploit the correlations among adjacent Gaussians, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used when decoding Gaussian distribution from the Tri-plane.

However, 3D segmentation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles with accurately delineating object boundaries, as Gaussian primitives often span across object edges due to their inherent volume and the lack of semantic guidance during training. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce Clear Object Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation (COB-GS), which aims to improve segmentation accuracy by clearly delineating blurry boundaries of interwoven Gaussian primitives within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that remove ambiguous Gaussians and sacrifice visual quality, COB-GS, as a 3DGS refinement method, jointly optimizes semantic and visual information, allowing the two different levels to cooperate with each other effectively. Specifically, for the semantic guidance, we introduce a boundary-adaptive Gaussian splitting technique that leverages semantic gradient statistics to identify and split ambiguous Gaussians, aligning them closely with object boundaries. For the visual optimization, we rectify the degraded suboptimal texture of the 3DGS scene, particularly along the refined boundary structures.

Specifically, we formulate 3DGS optimization as progressively fitting 3DGS to higher levels of frequency components in the training views, and propose a dynamic rendering resolution scheme that largely reduces the optimization complexity based on this formulation. Besides, we argue that a specific rendering resolution should cooperate with a proper primitive number for a better balance between computing redundancy and fitting quality, where we schedule the growth of the primitives to synchronize with the rendering resolution.

We observe that threshold modeling for events plays a crucial role in achieving high-quality reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a GS-Threshold Joint Modeling strategy, creating a mutually reinforcing process that greatly improves both 3D reconstruction and threshold modeling. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic-Static Decomposition strategy that first identifies dynamic areas by exploiting the inability of static Gaussians to represent motions, then applies a buffer-based soft decomposition to separate dynamic and static areas. This strategy accelerates rendering by avoiding unnecessary deformation in static areas, and focuses on dynamic areas to enhance fidelity. Additionally, we contribute the first event-inclusive 4D benchmark with synthetic and real-world dynamic scenes, on which our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",November 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16180,
337,OmniSplat: Taming Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting for Omnidirectional Images with Editable Capabilities,"Suyoung Lee,Jaeyoung Chung,Kihoon Kim,Jaeyoo Huh,Gunhee Lee,Minsoo Lee,Kyoung Mu Lee","Feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to generate scenes immediately without needing per-scene optimization. Although omnidirectional images are becoming more popular since they reduce the computation required for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a training-free fast feed-forward 3DGS generation framework for omnidirectional images. We adopt a Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images.

338,Dynamics-Aware Gaussian Splatting Streaming Towards Fast On-the-Fly 4D Reconstruction,"Zhening Liu,Yingdong Hu,Xinjie Zhang,Rui Song,Jiawei Shao,Zehong Lin,Jun Zhang","The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has led to great interest in 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Existing approaches mainly rely on full-length multi-view videos, while there has been limited exploration of online reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-timestep streaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives uniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the difference between dynamic and static features as well as neglecting the temporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to preserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage to distinguish dynamic and static primitives and optimize their movements, and an error-guided densification stage to accommodate emerging objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in online 4D reconstruction, demonstrating the fastest on-the-fly training, superior representation quality, and real-time rendering capability.

This evolution ranges from hand-crafted methods, through the era of deep learning, to more recent developments focused on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations. Recognizing the growing body of research and the absence of a comprehensive survey on the topic, this paper aims to provide the first comprehensive overview of SLAM progress through the lens of the latest advancements in radiance fields.

In inverse rendering, accurately modeling the shading processes of objects is essential for achieving high-fidelity results. Therefore, it is critical to incorporate global illumination to account for indirect lighting that reaches an object after multiple bounces across the scene. Previous 3DGS-based methods have attempted to model indirect lighting by characterizing indirect illumination as learnable lighting volumes or additional attributes of each Gaussian, while using baked occlusion to represent shadow effects. These methods, however, fail to accurately model the complex physical interactions between light and objects, making it impossible to construct realistic indirect illumination during relighting. To address this limitation, we propose to calculate indirect lighting using efficient path tracing with deferred shading. In our framework, we first render a G-buffer to capture the detailed geometry and material properties of the scene. Then, we perform physically-based rendering (PBR) only for direct lighting. With the G-buffer and previous rendering results, the indirect lighting can be calculated through a lightweight path tracing. Our method effectively models indirect lighting under any given lighting conditions, thereby achieving better novel view synthesis and competitive relighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our GI-GS outperforms existing baselines in both rendering quality and efficiency.",October 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02619,
341,Gaussian Splatting Lucas-Kanade,"Liuyue Xie,Joel Julin,Koichiro Niinuma,Laszlo A. Jeni","Gaussian Splatting and its dynamic extensions are effective for reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images when there is significant camera movement to facilitate motion parallax and when scene objects remain relatively static. However, in many real-world scenarios, these conditions are not met. As a consequence, data-driven semantic and geometric priors have been favored as regularizers, despite their bias toward training data and their neglect of broader movement dynamics.  Departing from this practice, we propose a novel analytical approach that adapts the classical Lucas-Kanade method to dynamic Gaussian splatting. By leveraging the intrinsic properties of the forward warp field network, we derive an analytical velocity field that, through time integration, facilitates accurate scene flow computation. This enables the precise enforcement of motion constraints on warp fields, thus constraining both 2D motion and 3D positions of the Gaussians. Our method excels in reconstructing highly dynamic scenes with minimal camera movement, as demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world scenes.",July 2024.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11309,

We leverage the geometry field proposed in recent work for stochastic opaque surfaces, which can then be converted to volume densities. We adapt Gaussian kernels or surfels to splat the geometry field rather than the volume, enabling precise reconstruction of opaque solids. Our first contribution is to derive an efficient and almost exact differentiable rendering algorithm for geometry fields parameterized by Gaussian surfels, while removing current approximations involving Taylor series and no self-attenuation. Next, we address the discontinuous loss landscape when surfels cluster near geometry, showing how to guarantee that the rendered color is a continuous function of the colors of the kernels, irrespective of ordering. Finally, we use latent representations with spherical harmonics encoded reflection vectors rather than spherical harmonics encoded colors to better address specular surfaces.

However, extending these achievements to enable free-form interactions and high-level semantic operations with complex 3D/4D scenes remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the limited availability of large-scale, annotated 3D/4D or multi-view datasets, which are crucial for generalizable vision and language tasks such as open-vocabulary and prompt-based segmentation, language-guided editing, and visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we introduce Feature4X, a universal framework designed to extend any functionality from 2D vision foundation model into the 4D realm, using only monocular video input, which is widely available from user-generated content. The ""X"" in Feature4X represents its versatility, enabling any task through adaptable, model-conditioned 4D feature field distillation. At the core of our framework is a dynamic optimization strategy that unifies multiple model capabilities into a single representation. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, Feature4X is the first method to distill and lift the features of video foundation models (e.g., SAM2, InternVideo2) into an explicit 4D feature field using Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments showcase novel view segment anything, geometric and appearance scene editing, and free-form VQA across all time steps, empowered by LLMs in feedback loops.

However, NNFM loss does not consider global style information. In addition, the implicit representation of NeRF limits their fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms. Extensive experiments show that our ABC-GS provides controllability of style transfer and achieves stylization results that are more faithfully aligned with the global style of the chosen artistic reference.

However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225,

Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene. Additionally, we incorporate high-frequency reinforce loss to further enhance the model's ability to capture detailed frequency information.

348,GaussianUDF: Inferring Unsigned Distance Functions through 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Shujuan Li,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han","Reconstructing open surfaces from multi-view images is vital in digitalizing complex objects in daily life. A widely used strategy is to learn unsigned distance functions (UDFs) by checking if their appearance conforms to the image observations through neural rendering. However, it is still hard to learn continuous and implicit UDF representations through 3D Gaussians splatting (3DGS) due to the discrete and explicit scene representation, i.e., 3D Gaussians. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel approach to bridge the gap between 3D Gaussians and UDFs. Our key idea is to overfit thin and flat 2D Gaussian planes on surfaces, and then, leverage the self-supervision and gradient-based inference to supervise unsigned distances in both near and far area to surfaces. To this end, we introduce novel constraints and strategies to constrain the learning of 2D Gaussians to pursue more stable optimization and more reliable self-supervision, addressing the challenges brought by complicated gradient field on or near the zero level set of UDFs. We report numerical and visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art on widely used benchmarks and real data to show our advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and sharpness of reconstructed open surfaces with boundaries.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19458,

Deep depth estimation is promising but existing works struggle with depth discontinuities, resulting in noisy predictions at object boundaries and do not achieve complete reconstruction omitting occluded surfaces. To address these issues we propose EndoLRMGS, that combines Large Reconstruction Modelling (LRM) and Gaussian Splatting (GS), for complete surgical scene reconstruction. GS reconstructs deformable tissues and LRM generates 3D models for surgical tools while position and scale are subsequently optimized by introducing orthogonal perspective joint projection optimization (OPjPO) to enhance accuracy. In experiments on four surgical videos from three public datasets, our method improves the Intersection-over-union (IoU) of tool 3D models in 2D projections by>40%. Additionally, EndoLRMGS improves the PSNR of the tools projection from 3.82% to 11.07%.

However, most existing methods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce eligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or efficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending the generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor whole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly accelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To facilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input sequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet fusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives from multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, we propose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce floaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is crucial in whole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS primitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process. Leveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the feed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire scene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly outperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole-scene reconstructions.

These core issues arise from its inherently unstructured design and the absence of efficient parallelization. To overcome these challenges simultaneously, we introduce CityGS-X, a scalable architecture built on a novel parallelized hybrid hierarchical 3D representation (PH^2-3D). As an early attempt, CityGS-X abandons the cumbersome merge-and-partition process and instead adopts a newly-designed batch-level multi-task rendering process. This architecture enables efficient multi-GPU rendering through dynamic Level-of-Detail voxel allocations, significantly improving scalability and performance. Through extensive experiments, CityGS-X consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of faster training times, larger rendering capacities, and more accurate geometric details in large-scale scenes. Notably, CityGS-X can train and render a scene with 5,000+ images in just 5 hours using only 4 * 4090 GPUs, a task that would make other alternative methods encounter Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues and fail completely.

This ability is crucial for tasks such as vision-language navigation and autonomous robotics. However, current methods struggle because they rely heavily on fine-tuning with 3D annotations and mask proposals, which limits their ability to handle diverse semantics and common knowledge required for effective reasoning. In this work, we propose ReasonGrounder, an LVLM-guided framework that uses hierarchical 3D feature Gaussian fields for adaptive grouping based on physical scale, enabling open-vocabulary 3D grounding and reasoning. ReasonGrounder interprets implicit instructions using large vision-language models (LVLM) and localizes occluded objects through 3D Gaussian splatting. By incorporating 2D segmentation masks from the SAM and multi-view CLIP embeddings, ReasonGrounder selects Gaussian groups based on object scale, enabling accurate localization through both explicit and implicit language understanding, even in novel, occluded views.

However, the substantial cost of storage and transmission of vanilla 3DGS hinders its further application (hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes for a single scene). Motivated by the achievements of prediction in video compression, we introduce the prediction technique into the anchor-based Gaussian representation to effectively reduce the bit rate. Specifically, we propose a spatial condition-based prediction module to utilize the grid-captured scene information for prediction, with a residual compensation strategy designed to learn the missing fine-grained information. Besides, to further compress the residual, we propose an instance-aware hyper prior, developing a structure-aware and instance-aware entropy model.

However, despite its effectiveness on high-end GPUs, it struggles on edge systems like the Jetson Orin NX Edge GPU, achieving only 7-17 FPS -- well below the over 60 FPS standard required for truly immersive AR/VR experiences. Addressing this challenge, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Gaussian-based AR/VR applications and identify the Gaussian Blending Stage, which intensively calculates each Gaussian's contribution at every pixel, as the primary bottleneck. In response, we propose a Gaussian Blending Unit (GBU), an edge GPU plug-in module for real-time rendering in AR/VR applications.

To achieve these objectives, we present Frequency-Guided Densification (FGD), which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality, enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas, improving rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ a gradient mask for 3D Gaussians and design a wavelet-subband loss to enhance rendering quality.

Garbin,Alexandros Lattas,George Kopanas,Paulo Gotardo,Thabo Beeler,Justus Thies,Timo Bolkart","We present SynShot, a novel method for the few-shot inversion of a drivable head avatar based on a synthetic prior. We tackle three major challenges. First, training a controllable 3D generative network requires a large number of diverse sequences, for which pairs of images and high-quality tracked meshes are not always available. Second, the use of real data is strictly regulated (e.g., under the General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates frequent deletion of models and data to accommodate a situation when a participant's consent is withdrawn). Synthetic data, free from these constraints, is an appealing alternative. Third, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle to generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often overfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning models trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a prior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities, expressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the pretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic head avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the head avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder that outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space. To account for the different modeling complexities over parts of the head (e.g., skin vs hair), we embed the prior with explicit control for upsampling the number of per-part primitives.

To address this gap, we introduce Gaussian Eigen Models (GEM), which provide high-quality, lightweight, and easily controllable head avatars. GEM utilizes 3D Gaussian primitives for representing the appearance combined with Gaussian splatting for rendering. Building on the success of mesh-based 3D morphable face models (3DMM), we define GEM as an ensemble of linear eigenbases for representing the head appearance of a specific subject. In particular, we construct linear bases to represent the position, scale, rotation, and opacity of the 3D Gaussians. This allows us to efficiently generate Gaussian primitives of a specific head shape by a linear combination of the basis vectors, only requiring a low-dimensional parameter vector that contains the respective coefficients. We propose to construct these linear bases (GEM) by distilling high-quality compute-intense CNN-based Gaussian avatar models that can generate expression-dependent appearance changes like wrinkles. These high-quality models are trained on multi-view videos of a subject and are distilled using a series of principal component analyses. Once we have obtained the bases that represent the animatable appearance space of a specific human, we learn a regressor that takes a single RGB image as input and predicts the low-dimensional parameter vector that corresponds to the shown facial expression.

However, due to the partial priors provided by single-view input, existing methods are often limited to reconstruct low-consistency 3D scenes with narrow fields of view from single-view input. These limitations make them less capable of generalizing to reconstruct immersive scenes. To address this problem, we propose ExScene, a two-stage pipeline to reconstruct an immersive 3D scene from any given single-view image. ExScene designs a novel multimodal diffusion model to generate a high-fidelity and globally consistent panoramic image. We then develop a panoramic depth estimation approach to calculate geometric information from panorama, and we combine geometric information with high-fidelity panoramic image to train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. Following this, we introduce a GS refinement technique with 2D stable video diffusion priors. We add camera trajectory consistency and color-geometric priors into the denoising process of diffusion to improve color and spatial consistency across image sequences. These refined sequences are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our ExScene achieves consistent and immersive scene reconstruction using only single-view input, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23881,
360,DiET-GS: Diffusion Prior and Event Stream-Assisted Motion Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Seungjun Lee,Gim Hee Lee","Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance high-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging event-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in either restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this paper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion deblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event streams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we introduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral, achieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we propose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the edge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing significantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.

361,StochasticSplats: Stochastic Rasterization for Sorting-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Shakiba Kheradmand,Delio Vicini,George Kopanas,Dmitry Lagun,Kwang Moo Yi,Mark Matthews,Andrea Tagliasacchi","3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a popular radiance field method, with many application-specific extensions. Most variants rely on the same core algorithm: depth-sorting of Gaussian splats then rasterizing in primitive order. This ensures correct alpha compositing, but can cause rendering artifacts due to built-in approximations. Moreover, for a fixed representation, sorted rendering offers little control over render cost and visual fidelity. For example, and counter-intuitively, rendering a lower-resolution image is not necessarily faster. In this work, we address the above limitations by combining 3D Gaussian splatting with stochastic rasterization. Concretely, we leverage an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the volume rendering equation. This removes the need for sorting, and allows for accurate 3D blending of overlapping Gaussians. The number of Monte Carlo samples further imbues 3DGS with a way to trade off computation time and quality. We implement our method using OpenGL shaders, enabling efficient rendering on modern GPU hardware. At a reasonable visual quality, our method renders more than four times faster than sorted rasterization.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24366,

We propose ERUPT (Efficient Rendering with Unposed Patch Transformer) a state-of-the-art scene reconstruction model capable of efficient scene rendering using unposed imagery. We introduce patch-based querying, in contrast to existing pixel-based queries, to reduce the compute required to render a target view. This makes our model highly efficient both during training and at inference, capable of rendering at 600 fps on commercial hardware. Notably, our model is designed to use a learned latent camera pose which allows for training using unposed targets in datasets with sparse or inaccurate ground truth camera pose. We show that our approach can generalize on large real-world data and introduce a new benchmark dataset (MSVS-1M) for latent view synthesis using street-view imagery collected from Mapillary. In contrast to NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, which require dense imagery and precise metadata, ERUPT can render novel views of arbitrary scenes with as few as five unposed input images. ERUPT achieves better rendered image quality than current state-of-the-art methods for unposed image synthesis tasks, reduces labeled data requirements by ~95\\% and decreases computational requirements by an order of magnitude, providing efficient novel view synthesis for diverse real-world scenes.",March 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24374,

However, applying it to extremely sparse, unposed views in unbounded 360\xc2\xb0 scenes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel neural rendering framework to accomplish the unposed and extremely sparse-view 3D reconstruction in unbounded 360\xc2\xb0 scenes. To resolve the spatial ambiguity inherent in unbounded scenes with sparse input views, we propose a layered Gaussian-based representation to effectively model the scene with distinct spatial layers. By employing a dense stereo reconstruction model to recover coarse geometry, we introduce a layer-specific bootstrap optimization to refine the noise and fill occluded regions in the reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an iterative fusion of reconstruction and generation alongside an uncertainty-aware training approach to facilitate mutual conditioning and enhancement between these two processes.

364,Self-Calibrating 4D Novel View Synthesis from Monocular Videos Using Gaussian Splatting,"Fang Li,Hao Zhang,Narendra Ahuja","Gaussian Splatting (GS) has significantly elevated scene reconstruction efficiency and novel view synthesis (NVS) accuracy compared to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), particularly for dynamic scenes. However, current 4D NVS methods, whether based on GS or NeRF, primarily rely on camera parameters provided by COLMAP and even utilize sparse point clouds generated by COLMAP for initialization, which lack accuracy as well are time-consuming. This sometimes results in poor dynamic scene representation, especially in scenes with large object movements, or extreme camera conditions e.g. small translations combined with large rotations. Some studies simultaneously optimize the estimation of camera parameters and scenes, supervised by additional information like depth, optical flow, etc. obtained from off-the-shelf models. Using this unverified information as ground truth can reduce robustness and accuracy, which does frequently occur for long monocular videos (with e.g. > hundreds of frames). We propose a novel approach that learns a high-fidelity 4D GS scene representation with self-calibration of camera parameters. It includes the extraction of 2D point features that robustly represent 3D structure, and their use for subsequent joint optimization of camera parameters and 3D structure towards overall 4D scene optimization. We demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of our method through extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results on several standard benchmarks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for 4D novel view synthesis.

365,LITA-GS: Illumination-Agnostic Novel View Synthesis via Reference-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting and Physical Priors,"Han Zhou,Wei Dong,Jun Chen","Directly employing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) on images with adverse illumination conditions exhibits considerable difficulty in achieving high-quality, normally-exposed representations due to: (1) The limited Structure from Motion (SfM) points estimated in adverse illumination scenarios fail to capture sufficient scene details; (2) Without ground-truth references, the intensive information loss, significant noise, and color distortion pose substantial challenges for 3DGS to produce high-quality results; (3) Combining existing exposure correction methods with 3DGS does not achieve satisfactory performance due to their individual enhancement processes, which lead to the illumination inconsistency between enhanced images from different viewpoints. To address these issues, we propose LITA-GS, a novel illumination-agnostic novel view synthesis method via reference-free 3DGS and physical priors. Firstly, we introduce an illumination-invariant physical prior extraction pipeline. Secondly, based on the extracted robust spatial structure prior, we develop the lighting-agnostic structure rendering strategy, which facilitates the optimization of the scene structure and object appearance. Moreover, a progressive denoising module is introduced to effectively mitigate the noise within the light-invariant representation. We adopt the unsupervised strategy for the training of LITA-GS and extensive experiments demonstrate that LITA-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) NeRF-based method while enjoying faster inference speed and costing reduced training time.

367,4D LangSplat: 4D Language Gaussian Splatting via Multimodal Large Language Models,"Wanhua Li,Renping Zhou,Jiawei Zhou,Yingwei Song,Johannes Herter,Minghan Qin,Gao Huang,Hanspeter Pfister","Learning 4D language fields to enable time-sensitive, open-ended language queries in dynamic scenes is essential for many real-world applications. While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively.

Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context.

To this end, we first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality, formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature matching strategy coupled with a multi-scale Gaussian decoding model to enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning.

Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated high-quality results with real-time performance, it still faces challenges in indoor scenes with large, textureless regions, resulting in incomplete and noisy reconstructions due to poor point cloud initialization and underconstrained optimization. Inspired by the continuity of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling surfaces, we propose a unified optimization framework that integrates neural signed distance fields (SDFs) with 3DGS for accurate geometry reconstruction and real-time rendering. This framework incorporates a neural SDF field to guide the densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to model scenes accurately even with poor initialized point clouds. Simultaneously, the geometry represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting its point sampling. Additionally, we introduce two regularization terms based on normal and edge priors to resolve geometric ambiguities in textureless areas and enhance detail accuracy.

Recent advances in scene modeling have made significant progress, with NeRF and 3DGS techniques emerging as powerful tools for reconstructing complex scenes. However, while effective for novel view synthesis, these methods typically struggle with challenging scene editing tasks, such as physics-based rain simulation. In contrast, traditional physics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as raindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set up high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability, limiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work, we introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both physics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain effects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method is the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation techniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and efficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our method supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users flexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours.

A critical and initial step in integrating the LiDAR and camera data is the calibration of the LiDAR-camera system. Most existing calibration methods rely on auxiliary target objects, which often involve complex manual operations, whereas targetless methods have yet to achieve practical effectiveness. Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the calibration robustness and accuracy.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00525,https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2025.3552955

Inspired by deformable DEtection TRansformer, we design separate queries for 3D Gaussians and camera parameters and update them layer by layer through deformable Transformer layers, enabling joint optimization in a single network. This design demonstrates better performance because to accurately render views that closely approximate ground-truth images relies on precise estimation of both 3D Gaussians and camera parameters. In such a design, the centers of 3D Gaussians are projected onto each view by camera parameters to get projected points, which are regarded as 2D reference points in deformable cross-attention. With camera-aware multi-view deformable cross-attention (CaMDFA), 3D Gaussians and camera parameters are intrinsically connected by sharing the 2D reference points. Additionally, 2D reference point determined rays (RayRef) defined from camera centers to the reference points assist in modeling relationship between 3D Gaussians and camera parameters through RQ-decomposition on an overdetermined system of equations derived from the rays, enhancing the relationship between 3D Gaussians and camera parameters.

Compared with previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that requires elusive multi-view datasets or tedious personalized learning/inference, MGGtalk enables more practical and broader applications. However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the source image.

However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g., three-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training views, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many existing approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D generative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this paper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple changes in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians during the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows non-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their visibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the optimization process for rendering with sparse input views. Such simple operation effectively alleviates the overfitting problem and enhances the quality of novel view synthesis. By simply applying DropGaussian to the original 3DGS framework, we can achieve the competitive performance with existing prior-based 3DGS methods in sparse-view settings of benchmark datasets without any additional complexity.

GS-Diff further integrates several enhancements, including appearance embedding, monocular depth priors, dynamic object modeling, anisotropy regularization, and advanced rasterization techniques, to tackle geometric and photometric challenges in real-world settings. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GS-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01960,
383,UAVTwin: Neural Digital Twins for UAVs using Gaussian Splatting,"Jaehoon Choi,Dongki Jung,Yonghan Lee,Sungmin Eum,Dinesh Manocha,Heesung Kwon","We present UAVTwin, a method for creating digital twins from real-world environments and facilitating data augmentation for training downstream models embedded in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, our approach focuses on synthesizing foreground components, such as various human instances in motion within complex scene backgrounds, from UAV perspectives. This is achieved by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing backgrounds along with controllable synthetic human models that display diverse appearances and actions in multiple poses. To the best of our knowledge, UAVTwin is the first approach for UAV-based perception that is capable of generating high-fidelity digital twins based on 3DGS. The proposed work significantly enhances downstream models through data augmentation for real-world environments with multiple dynamic objects and significant appearance variations-both of which typically introduce artifacts in 3DGS-based modeling. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel appearance modeling strategy and a mask refinement module to enhance the training of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We demonstrate the high quality of neural rendering by achieving a 1.23 dB improvement in PSNR compared to recent methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of data augmentation by showing a 2.5% to 13.7% improvement in mAP for the human detection task.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02158,
384,Distilling Multi-view Diffusion Models into 3D Generators,"Hao Qin,Luyuan Chen,Ming Kong,Mengxu Lu,Qiang Zhu","We introduce DD3G, a formulation that Distills a multi-view Diffusion model (MV-DM) into a 3D Generator using gaussian splatting. DD3G compresses and integrates extensive visual and spatial geometric knowledge from the MV-DM by simulating its ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory, ensuring the distilled generator generalizes better than those trained solely on 3D data. Unlike previous amortized optimization approaches, we align the MV-DM and 3D generator representation spaces to transfer the teacher's probabilistic flow to the student, thus avoiding inconsistencies in optimization objectives caused by probabilistic sampling. The introduction of probabilistic flow and the coupling of various attributes in 3D Gaussians introduce challenges in the generation process. To tackle this, we propose PEPD, a generator consisting of Pattern Extraction and Progressive Decoding phases, which enables efficient fusion of probabilistic flow and converts a single image into 3D Gaussians within 0.06 seconds. Furthermore, to reduce knowledge loss and overcome sparse-view supervision, we design a joint optimization objective that ensures the quality of generated samples through explicit supervision and implicit verification. Leveraging existing 2D generation models, we compile 120k high-quality RGBA images for distillation. Experiments on synthetic and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

While state-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation to enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, they suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to inconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus problem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the multi-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and consistency.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02316,
386,Toward Real-world BEV Perception: Depth Uncertainty Estimation via Gaussian Splatting,"Shu-Wei Lu,Yi-Hsuan Tsai,Yi-Ting Chen","Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has gained significant attention because it provides a unified representation to fuse multiple view images and enables a wide range of down-stream autonomous driving tasks, such as forecasting and planning. Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation. While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm, and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance with only a 0.4% IoU difference.",April 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01957,

To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \\& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\\times$ speedup.

We propose a novel approach that leverages object masks to enable targeted reconstruction, resulting in object-centric models. Additionally, we introduce an occlusion-aware pruning strategy to minimize the number of Gaussians without compromising quality. Our method reconstructs compact object models, yielding object-centric Gaussian and mesh representations that are up to 96% smaller and up to 71% faster to train compared to the baseline while retaining competitive quality.

In particular, our technique enables high-quality scene reconstruction from Large field-of-view (FOV) imagery taken with wide-angle lenses, allowing the scene to be modeled from a smaller number of images. Our approach introduces a novel method for modeling complex lens distortions using a hybrid network that combines invertible residual networks with explicit grids. This design effectively regularizes the optimization process, achieving greater accuracy than conventional camera models. Additionally, we propose a cubemap-based resampling strategy to support large FOV images without sacrificing resolution or introducing distortion artifacts. Our method is compatible with the fast rasterization of Gaussian Splatting, adaptable to a wide variety of camera lens distortion, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",February 2025.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09563,

Our key contribution is enabling gradient-based optimization by parsing shape programs, or more precisely procedural models designed in Blender, into efficient PyTorch code. While there are many possible applications of our PyTochGeoNodes, we show that a combination of PyTorchGeoNodes with genetic algorithm is a method of choice to optimize both discrete and continuous shape program parameters for 3D reconstruction and understanding of 3D object parameters.

393,Enhancing Temporal Consistency in Video Editing by Reconstructing Videos with 3D Gaussian Splatting,"Inkyu Shin,Qihang Yu,Xiaohui Shen,In So Kweon,Kuk-Jin Yoon,Liang-Chieh Chen","Recent advancements in zero-shot video diffusion models have shown promise for text-driven video editing, but challenges remain in achieving high temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (x1.9, x4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively.

To address it, we propose an interpretable single-view 3DGS framework, termed 3DisGS, to discover both coarse- and fine-grained 3D semantics via hierarchical disentangled representation learning (DRL). Specifically, the model employs a dual-branch architecture, consisting of a point cloud initialization branch and a triplane-Gaussian generation branch, to achieve coarse-grained disentanglement by separating 3D geometry and visual appearance features. Subsequently, fine-grained semantic representations within each modality are further discovered through DRL-based encoder-adapters. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve unsupervised interpretable 3DGS.

Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration.

These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions.

Since most existing buildings will still be in use by 2050, retrofitting is crucial for emissions reduction. However, current building assessment methods rely mainly on qualitative thermal imaging, which limits data-driven decisions for energy savings. On the other hand, quantitative assessments using finite element analysis (FEA) offer precise insights but require manual CAD design, which is tedious and error-prone. Recent advances in 3D reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, enable precise 3D modeling from sparse images but lack clearly defined volumes and the interfaces between them needed for FEA. We propose Thermoxels, a novel voxel-based method able to generate FEA-compatible models, including both geometry and temperature, from a sparse set of RGB and thermal images. Using pairs of RGB and thermal images as input, Thermoxels represents a scene's geometry as a set of voxels comprising color and temperature information. After optimization, a simple process is used to transform Thermoxels' models into tetrahedral meshes compatible with FEA. We demonstrate Thermoxels' capability to generate RGB+Thermal meshes of 3D scenes, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. To showcase the practical applications of Thermoxels' models, we conduct a simple heat conduction simulation using FEA, achieving convergence from an initial state defined by Thermoxels' thermal reconstruction.
